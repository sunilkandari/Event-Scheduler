to meet : Jennifer,I had forgotten to invite Roy, but I did tell him about the meeting, and he was OK w/getting the notes after the fact.  I also told him I would not forget to keep him in the loop and invited to any future meetings.As for Ron Smith, I really have egg on my face.  I totally forgot about Ron (I was thinking only Instromet, and S-J was running with that).  I think that in my excitement and effort to get this meeting put together, I overlooked a few important details.  I will certainly do a better job next time!Thanks for the reminder!JYp.s. I was unable to get w/George during the day yesterday, but I did catch him at about 6:35pm.  I gave him my update on the latest BMC/EBS activities (Crowder is going to meet w/Philippe today).  He gave me some good feedback, and I think that for the most part, I'm on the right track.  The only thing I've done which I feel could provide (potential) negative exposure, based on feedback from George; is discussing w/BMC the idea that perhaps EBS could do the buy/take $1MM, and pay/keep credit of $2MM...I wasn't admonished, but KGW felt that I would have been better off not discussing that w/BMC...You and I can talk, though, because I'm not so sure that it was a bad thing, in this case.  But next time, there won't be a next time - so that won't be an issue anyway!Jennifer Medcalf@ECT12/07/2000 08:45 AM To: Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON cc:  Subject: Re: Bristol Babcock/Pagosa Energy - Well Master/Enron meeting notesJeff,The meeting minutes look great and that it was a very beneficial meeting for all parties.  Was Roy or Ron invited?  If not let's make sure that they are at the next meeting so we do not get any static from them.Jennifer 
meeting with : Meeting Minutes: Bristol Babcock, Pagosa Energy/Well Master, EBS, and GSSMeeting Purpose:  Business overview, solutions identification/brainstormingDate: 12/1/00EnronEBS Attendee:Anthony GilmoreGlobal Strategic Sourcing Attendee: Jeff YoungfleshBristol BabcockKevin FinnanJim GriffethPagosa Energy/Well MasterRob BenderDISCUSSION POINTS:1)  Bristol and Well Master feel that there is significant opportunity, with placement of enough BBI TeleFlow devices (integrated flow computer, corrector, recorder and controller/RTU) in North America that the data transmission needs would generate enough bandwidth demand that it would be of interest to EBS to provide some of its solutions to Bristol & Pagosa Energy "unified solutions" (quotes are mine - JKY) for the gas industry.  NOTE:  this could take a longer term to reach the necessary "critical status", due to the need for a very large hardware install base since each TeleFlow generates only about 11 - 12,000 bytes of data per day in its report bursts.1a)  In this scenario, the EBS opportunity would be primarily driven by sales of product solutions by BBI and Pagosa, which would include EBS network capacity.  (a "sell-through" effect for EBS)2)  There could also be enough demand for bandwidth- or related EBS solutions to Bristol by including Bristol's own internal I/T bandwidth consumption that a near-term solutions engagement would be desirable.  NOTE:  this could accelerate to the necessary "critical status", bringing to EBS more solutions demand due to the addition of "sell-to".  The "sell-through" effect would be present with Bristol/Pagosa selling solutions which use EBS' solutions (a sales "channel"), as well as EBS "sell-to" BBI & Pagosa for their own internal consumption of bandwidth.____________________________________________________________________ACTION ITEMS:  1)  Bristol will provide Anthony (Tony) Gilmore of Enron Broadband Services the necessary contact information for the appropriate people in FKI's (Bristol's parent co.) Info/Technology area.2) Enron GSS contacts (J Youngflesh) will attempt to ascertain if there would be value to Enron (GPG?) and/or its customers if they had the ability to execute nomination control all the way to the ground (upstream of gas well-head).3) EBS (Tony Gilmore) will begin working on the I/T discovery process, attempting to aggregate total Bandwidth demand: (usage patterns/volume/etc.) at Bristol and/or Pagosa.3a)  Per Rob Bender, Tony Gilmore should be contacting Al Freimeyer (sp?) at Pagosa to understand the volum of data from their daily batches from well-to-vendor.  Rob provided Tony Al's telephone number on 12/1.4)  Enron GSS to contact Ron Smith - waterSCADA.com - to investigate parallel opportunity (gas / water analog).5)  EBS and BBI/Pagosa will begin (internal efforts) to figure out ways of getting the TeleFlow CDPD data onto the EBS "Enron Intelligent Network"Next Meeting: TBDPlease let me know if I've missed anything.Thank you, JeffJeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716Bender Rob <rebende@earthlink.net>12/05/2000 08:50 AM  To: jeff.youngflesh@enron.com cc: Anthony_Gilmore@enron.net Subject: Meeting 12-1-00Dear Jeff:It was a pleasure meeting with you last Friday with Jim Griffith andKevin Finnan of Bristol Babcock.  Perhaps by now you have had anopportunity to review the  http://wells.pagosaenergy.com web site andlook at aspects of the "demo" section.  This is a very dynamic programwith changes, upgrades, and customization taking place all the time tomeet the individual needs of our customers.There may well be a good fit here as we are seeking ever faster means ofcommunication and will be requiring a substantial infrastructure notonly for communications but for data base hosting as well.  While yet inits infancy we have received very positive feedback and interest fromnumerous oil and gas companies in the industry.  An alliance with Enronto help us on the road to becoming the "Microsoft" of oil and gas wellautomation would be a very alluring prospect.  I would like to keep adialog going between us to scope out areas of mutual benefit for our twocompanies where such an alliance would make sense.I hope to hear from you soon.Sincerely,Rob Bender,President - PagosaEnergy.comrob@pagosaenergy.com
meetings on : Thad,Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual meetings?  We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in NJ.  Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week.  However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible alignments and opportunities.  This would include two primary areas:1)  EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use:  what types of potential solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and2)  EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the (common) markets served:  "sell with" (each other); and "sell through" (channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as sales channels for each other's sales forces.These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value propositions, such that they would have a "jumping off point" for a go-to-market effort (item #2, above).  In addition, the technical aspects of some of the "EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use" (item #1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be addressed.Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days synchronized with your executives'.  Thank you,JeffJeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716
to meet : Karen,Thank you for the update.  It looks like we'll plan on having the EBS/Avaya meetings on January 10th and 11th, 2001.  The first day will be a full day, the second will be 1/2 day, a.m. session.  You have asked me to provide a list of Enron attendees, titles, which day(s) they would likely attend, and some background information on the meeting(s) purposes.  An explanation of the meetings' proposed focus and probable attendees is in the attached meeting notes.  The notes are from the November meeting which we coordinated and held for Enron Broadband Services and Dave Johnson.  By copy of this note to Kim Godfrey, we'll update the EBS executives on the meetings, and work on arranging their calendar availability.  So far, we have had the EBS execs' calendars penciled in for the time slot of January 9-11.  At this point, I would expect that the EBS attendee list would look something like this:  Jim Crowder, VP, Enterprise Services; Enron Broadband Services - day 2 Everett Plante, VP and CIO, Enron Broadband Services - day 2Larry Ciscon, VP Software Architecture, EBS - day 1&2  (selected team members of Larry's organization - individuals TBD by Larry) - day 1  Steve Pearlman, VP, Strategic Development, EBS - day 2 and/or day 1Kim Godfrey, Director, East Origination, EBS - day 1&2  Jeff Youngflesh, Director, Business Development, Enron Global Strategic Sourcing - day 1&2      (others as suggested by Kim Godfrey or other EBS executive)From Avaya, the EBS team would like to meet with Dave Johnson, Serge Minassian, John Stephenson, and their selected Avaya team members.  Per my conversation with you earlier today, the Enron Broadband Services meetings w/Avaya will need to be scheduled such that the overall agenda will "flip-flop" day 1 with day 2.  Originally, the first day was going to be a half-day executive strategizing meeting in the p.m. (allowing for travel to NJ), and the 2nd day to be more a product- or solutions-focused effort, with a full day's agenda.  Based on the fact that Dave Johnson will only be available the morning of the 11th, the meeting schedule will be reversed, such that the "full day/products/solutions" meetings will precede the half-day executive strategy sessions.  I have checked w/Barbara Korp, and Serge Minassian and John Stephenson are both available on the 11th, as well (John Stephenson would have a hard stop at 10:30).Thank you,Jeff Youngflesh713-345-5968

Emshwiller, Rebecca Smith an=d Jathon Sapsford10/26/2001The Wall Street JournalC1(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank cred=it lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu=idity.=20Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of =outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a= person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy c=oncern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv=e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access =to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its= banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.= But, "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last =few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," s=aid an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial o=fficer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we are mak=ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate= liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."=20The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over= the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the natio=n's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e=lectricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involv=ed in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it= reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder =equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange =Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction=s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, And=rew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday.=20The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, pu=t Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor'=s, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investor=s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. =In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have t=o fall several notches.=20If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade ra=ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions= of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=isting shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enro=n was down six cents at $16.35.=20Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes mo=re than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enr=on's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $=884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999.=20The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und=erperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.=5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India=. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs =of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, parti=cularly in today's slower economy.=20The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha=t have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealing=s with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents r=elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu=ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected =to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclose=d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of =the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other em=ployee-related entity known as Chewco.=20Chewco was established in 1997 "with approximately $400 million in capital =commitments" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the pa=rtnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were =purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions =for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a manag=ing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the docum=ent.=20Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em=ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any =comment regarding its dealings with Chewco.=20Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t=o run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person =at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In respon=se to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that "Micha=el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron." Mr. Fastow repeatedly h=as declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partn=erships in July.=20This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar=ding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to repor=t any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves "any director or execut=ive officer." By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that =category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumab=ly wouldn't have.=20However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo=ard seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. =According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a "mate=rial" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The= statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents i=n charge of major business units and "other persons who perform similar pol=icy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of =management."Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

In 1999, =he sold shares for a total of $26 million.=20In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying= the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate off=icials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by compan=y insiders and called the sales "a personal decision." Many sales by Enron =insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon afte=r option exercises.=20Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines =should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research dire=ctor of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on in=vestment ideas.=20Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman= and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice= has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning =in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skillin=g -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during =the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares.=20Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment.=20Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they s=old 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3=.4 million shares for $123.1 million.=20Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company s=hares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron='s chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Secur=ities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the= company and Mr. Fastow.=20Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each=, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based= on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composi=te trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Fi=nancial/Lancer Analytics says.=20Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment.=20On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston=, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose= problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down th=e value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The s=uit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 mil=lion of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09Credit MarketsEnron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Cre=dit-Rating ConcernsBy Jathon Sapsford and Suzanne McGeeStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal10/26/2001The Wall Street JournalC15(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock= amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse.=20Not for long, some bond traders say.In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million =issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on= the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% d=rop during the past two weeks.=20That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct.= 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resu=lting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's pric=e translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. gove=rnment bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two we=eks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of "=spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl=e B or lower.=20Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing= late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit l=ines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, =investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yes=terday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in b=onds, a small percentage of a typical trade.=20Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating con=cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of= troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga=tion, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer.=20"Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest," said Harold Ri=vkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N=.J.=20In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect thems=elves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a "default swap" -=- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at fac=e value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit be=ing insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lu=cent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology com=pany's troubles earlier during the year.=20Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-=rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above= the noninvestment-grade level.=20Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possib=le downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last we=ek. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of pu=tting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its lon=g-term ratings outlook to "negative," citing concerns about the company's f=inancial flexibility.)=20Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for= the worst. "These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward dis=tressed levels," said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an =independent fixed-income research firm in New York. "They aren't distressed= yet, but they are headed in that direction."=20If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the c=ompany's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade s=ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to= make good on its commitments.=20Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known fo=r trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in =the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacit=y and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles a=bout a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets.==20Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating=, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commoditi=es markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without th=at credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts= to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derive=d from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or c=ommodity.=20"Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perceptio=n that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses," s=aid Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. "Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron='s counterparties" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agree=ment with Enron -- "is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and l=ooking for ways to minimize it or offset it," Mr. Reynolds said.=20To be sure, Enron, despite its recent woes, remains a strong company, credi=t analysts said. "I don't think anyone's seriously thinking that this is a =company that would ever default," Mr. Reynolds said.=20"So far, our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are s=ticking with them," said Ron Barone, managing director of Standard & Poor's= utility energy project finance group. "No one has cut credit lines or aske=d for additional collateral that we have identified. And customers have pub=licly stated that it's business as usual."=20Yet analysts say the arrival of distressed-debt traders on the scene could =make life more difficult for Enron and its management. Traders expect Enron='s new Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon and Chairman Kenneth Lay to =make the rounds of Wall Street next week, meeting with rating agencies, deb=t-trading desks, big bond holders and banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase & =Co. and Citigroup Inc.=20Treasurys=20Treasurys rallied on optimism that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rat=es more than previously expected after a spate of economic reports that doc=umented how weak the economy was after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.=20Prices also gained as the market finished digesting the week's flood of Tre=asury, corporate and agency debt issues.=20At 4 p.m. EDT, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 13/32 point, or $=4.0625 per $1,000 face value, at 103 20/32. Its yield fell to 4.537% from 4=.588% Wednesday, as yields move inversely to prices.=20The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 22/32 point at 101 11/32 to yield =5.284%, down from 5.330% Wednesday.=20Fed policy makers are slated to meet on Nov. 6.

Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i=ts most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't fig=ure out.In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede=d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif=ficult to value the company. The company's "lack of disclosure and transpar=ency," he says, is "a longstanding Enron hallmark."=20So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did =bump Enron off its "U.S. Select List," which consists of a few dozen top st=ock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's la=rger but prestigious "Recommended List" of 200 or so favored stocks, where =it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993.=20"Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . =. . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze =it' or `I can't figure it out,' " says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclos=ed number of Enron shares. "If that were the case, there would be an awful =lot of industries we couldn't follow."=20Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week.=20"Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a= black box," says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, =who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiti=ng from its fall -- throughout this year. "It was really a trust-me story, =when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l=evel of trust."=20True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts lo=ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly= on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had.==20But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still rec=ommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practic=es are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend tha=t others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operatio=ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable?=20Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the= issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago b=y bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time =and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger=ing questions about the company's various partnership transactions.=20Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th=e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings.==20Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darli=ng, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and= level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the= stock, 10 had a "strong buy" or equivalent rating on the stock, according =to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a "buy," thoug=h not strongly.=20Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a "se=ll" rating on Enron.=20The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile exampl=es of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospe=ct seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warrante=d.=20Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general coll=apse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- part=icularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the compani=es they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis=ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees an=d other revenue.=20Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, fo=r one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Bost=on, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette=, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.=20"Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that= hasn't been involved," says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer=, who still rates the stock a "strong buy" with a $40 price target. "They p=ay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."=20He adds, "We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Ar=e we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to pro=vide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation o=n the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p=erformed."=20Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron,= calls his holding "a meaningful investment" that is "not small." But he di=sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer sa=ys his clients "are happy to know" he has a stake in Enron, because it show=s he puts his money where his mouth is.=20In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosur=es of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficu=lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, =he wrote that he and many other investors historically "have given Enron th=e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings" and position a=s an industry leader.=20"There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accura=tely where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make =their money, but every quarter they do," he says. "It's hard to get inside =to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."=20CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasio=nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the= financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron='s partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains= "confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] an=d an ultimate recovery in the share price."=20"I know I'm wrong on the stock," Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these= prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even =in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue =as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stoc=k doesn't have much further to fall.=20Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. "Even in relative terms=, analysts remain very bullish on this stock," says Chuck Hill, director of= research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock o=n Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a "buy" rating. Enron scores a 1.6=. "This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad= news is out," Mr. Hill says.=20In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i=t to "sell" from "buy," with a brief stop at "hold." While she is the only =analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her rece=nt downgrades come "too little, too late."=20Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the co=mpany's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives= are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance=, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un=der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said "no,=" she says.=20In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC "inquiry," she= asked Enron about the previous denial. "They told me it is an inquiry, not= an investigation," she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned= of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he =is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Ins=titute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior lead=ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's =reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h=is predecessor.=20From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a =respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing wa=y.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no =doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev=en the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt='s concerns about improper management of earnings.On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement acti=on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t=o report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one= could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a =fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised qu=estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th=an a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the ac=counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff me=mber, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer.=20In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is goi=ng to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is crea=te an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C=. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.''=20A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client t=o restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, a=re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much i=n favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview=, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state=ments and restatements.''=20Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which woul=d certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more ag=gressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like =a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors= who try to resist misleading accounting.=20In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization =that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pi=tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence.=20The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess a=t Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. I=t will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accountin=g was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai=n -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made wi=th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer=.=20''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whe=ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur=es.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.Photo: Harvey L. Pitt=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

United Airlines Just a Little Too HonestRule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse.=20Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J=ames Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company "will pe=rish" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have wors=ened since the terrorist attacks. "Today, we are literally hemorrhaging mon=ey," he wrote.=20In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL =(UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders= have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,0=00 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expecte=d to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings.=20But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeli=ng that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24=% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, =UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti=es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one un=ion have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked.=20Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but s=ometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either=. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise.=202. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War=20Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our an=nihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy so=me DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car?=20That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that C=ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef=forts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded= the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco=nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. "The economy is per=haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa=r on global terrorists," says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. "Wa=r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."=20For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just su=perfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savin=gs bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by t=he federal government.=20In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war =bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the =same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bo=nds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books.=203. Enron AgainLast week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - co=mmentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, =following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. =Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the =company on what's delicately termed a "leave of absence."=20In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly =reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his invol=vement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake =of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowle=dged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confid=ence.=20But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disincli=nation to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure "unse=ttling," noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the =day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase,= Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And th=ere could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission h=as issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions.=204. Gold Diggers=20It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately=, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds.

According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.=08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an e=mbarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody='s favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same =period, they were up 7.13%.=20Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades= -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't =seem to have boosted gold prices significantly.

Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-termcredit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable byStandard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell49 percent in the past week.     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will runshort on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doingbusiness with the largest energy broker, customers say.     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power andnatural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energyrisk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complexderivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk offluctuating commodities prices.     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade atMoody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron'slong-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needsgood credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners fromdemanding collateral and to settle transactions.     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron ishandling less business, Kilduff said.     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a majorproblem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital ifthings really broke down because the numbers are that big.''     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund forthe wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. Morethan a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billionto avoid a collapse.                         Needs Cash Daily     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and othercommodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments tohedge against price swings in the goods.     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demandingdifferent terms than before.''     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash everyday to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps naturalgas and other energy investments with Enron.     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does oneor the other every day, and someone pays the difference.     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enoughmoney to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion inbank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined toprotect the credit rating, Enron has said.     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios atthis point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.                        Investor Questions     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial OfficerAndrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities andExchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships heran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. Theyfell 6 cents to $16.35 today.     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels aboveinvestment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all ratethe company's debt at investment grade.     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formedto buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan tomeet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the saleproceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make goodon any shortfall.                            Little Time     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shutout of the money markets.     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. Thecompany, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficultyfinding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SECinvestigation was announced, the traders said.     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percentyield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enoughtime to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think topacify the market.''                           Ripple Effect     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book ofhedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves somany partners, participants and companies that a failure wouldpose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-TermCapital Management's.     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counterparty to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said JeffCaughron, manager of $400 million in investments for TinkerFederal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, therecould be a big ripple effect.''     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won'tbe able to pay bills owed to power producers such as CalpineCorp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said ChrisEllinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron arefueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companiesselling power to Enron are suffering.''     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as theyhave in the past.                         Market Maker     Enron supplies services some customers considerirreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedgesweather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to payEnron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operateat peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the damscan't operate as well, Enron pays the district.     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, thatagreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves fromelectricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way ithelps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too littlerainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing sowould trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balancesheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.--Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom at 609-750-4651, or atEnron Broadband Begins Closing London, Singapore OfficesBy Erwin SebaOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/25/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications unit will clos=e down its trading offices in London and Singapore over the next six months=.=20Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees =overseas and haven't made a public announcement of plans to consolidate Asi=an and European bandwidth trading operations at the company's Houston headq=uarters."It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out= there in the market now," Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie Jame=s said in response to questions from Dow Jones Newswires.=20The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones.

(CPN) has no credit exposure to tradin=g partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conferenc=e call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California ab=out renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the= company signed with the state earlier this year.=20Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share =compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's co=nsistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conferen=ce call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, li=ke Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric =power stations in a few years.Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of= the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this= week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure t=o Enron.=20"We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net expo=sure to Enron," said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management,= Paul Pasoli. "We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit th=reshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."=20When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be ha=lted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a litt=le money.=20In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the sta=te of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars= of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under= those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now th=an when California bought this past winter and spring.=20"Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont=racts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties t=o do so as well," said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. "If there= are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be =happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."=20As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its p=rogram to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is abo=ut three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capac=ity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d=ifference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said tha=t difference, or "spark spread," has grown the past few months. Furthermore=, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all pr=ojects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment.=20As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually thr=ough 2005.

Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behal=f of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between Janu=ary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").=20The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,= by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and= operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that= the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=ial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets= on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surp=rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring ch=arges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the= third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently,= Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind=ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled =by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin=g more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o=f the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the =price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period,= Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron= common stock to unsuspecting investors.If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no late=r than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this =class action.

Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself onsharing the wealth with employees when the company was postingrecord profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,employees are sharing the pain.     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to thebulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensationpackage, most employees get stock options equal to5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman MeredithPhilipp said.     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the endof 2000, all at average prices above the company's current shareprice. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enronspokeswoman Karen Denne said.     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options inDecember or January. Employees can't cash the options in and makea profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. Atthe end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,the board set a strike price of about $80.     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commissionwas asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, whowas ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. Onepartnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial marketsgroup, as CFO late yesterday.                         Unvested Options     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employeeshadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million ofthem, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 ashare. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options inother industries, such as technology and telecommunications, sayit becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fallbelow their options.     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuanticBuck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensationconsulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, andit's a continued disincentive to them.''     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice itsemployees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock optiongrant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role asthe company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent ofemployees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but wasexercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above$36.88 since Aug. 29.--Margot Habiby in the Dallas newsroom (214) 954-9452, or

(ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources. "It's not getting any better," said one major energy broker.Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer. Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron. The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said. Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering. "They've been cut off from so many people," said one electricity trader. Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level. The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago. "We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility," Thode said. Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed. Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating "evolving." Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings. -By Mark Golden, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4604; mark.golden@dowjones.com (John Edmiston in Houston and Jon Kamp in Chicago also contributed to this article.)Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. USA: UPDATE 3-Dynegy says in talks on Enron merger structure.By C. Bryson Hull11/27/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.HOUSTON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Energy trader Dynegy Inc. confirmed on Tuesday it was in talks with floundering rival Enron Corp. over their proposed merger, as sources familiar with the negotiations indicated the final buyout price may be slashed some 40 percent. "I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the deal," Dynegy spokesman John Sousa told Reuters. He declined to give further details.Dynegy had planned to buy its Houston rival for $9 billion in stock and is currently in a "due diligence" examination of Enron's complex financial books that began before the Thanksgiving holiday last Thursday. The buyout offer, finalized Nov. 9, would have had Dynegy paying about $10.41 for each share of Enron, but Enron's shares have since cratered to near $4, stoking investor fears the merger will not go through as planned - if at all. The stock exchange ratio under discussion could fall from the originally proposed valuation of 0.2685 of each Dynegy share for each Enron share to around 0.15 instead, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Enron is willing to accept the lower valuation, given the pressure on its stock price, the sources said. Enron's shares bounced on Dynegy's confirmation of the restructuring talks, trading up 22 cents at $4.23 in late afternoon action on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares had dipped as low as $3.84 in late-morning dealings and as high $4.49. Dynegy's shares gained 4.7 percent or $1.83 to move to $41.08 on the NYSE. Also on the table were negotiations to extend maturation of Enron's debt past the close of the merger, expected in the third quarter of 2002. The sources said an announcement was possible on a new infusion of at least $500 million in cash, which Enron has said it was seeking. There also seemed to be an accord over who gets first crack at the Northern Natural Gas Pipeline, which would be Dynegy's consolation prize if the deal fell apart, a source said. Published reports have said that investment banks J.P. Morgan and Salomon Smith Barney had already accepted the pipeline as collateral in other loans, and may dispute Dynegy's ownership if the deal breaks up. "The pipeline is far more valuable than what has already been collateralized. There's a solid earnings stream from that thing," said one source familiar with the discussions. ONE TRADING UNIT SHUT DOWN Two sources confirmed to Reuters that Enron's equity trading unit has been told it is being closed and that the roughly 60 employees there are being laid off. Enron was not immediately available for comment. Those layoffs, part of broader job cuts expected as part of the Dynegy buyout, point to an acute problem for Enron - the loss of volume in its premier trading franchise. Enron's trading partners have been cutting back transactions with North America's largest energy trader because of credit concerns. "This business is hugely dependent on volumes and volume growth. It is the principal reason that Dynegy is making the deal. If it's worth a lot less then Enron is worth less. It's vital to stop the bleeding in its core trading and marketing business," said Commerzbank analyst Andre Meade. But as Enron's stock continued to lose value, down over 50 percent since Dynegy's initial bid, it seemed likely the purchase price would fall as well. Enron has seen its market capitalization drop to around $3 billion, from $60 billion at the start of 2001.

All Rights Reserved. Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New TermsBy Christina CheddarOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES11/27/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky. Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional funding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt.Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%. Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trading levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price. According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion. The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion, the person said. As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion. Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer. But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accustomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way. Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy. Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. "There's nothing like accounting to scare people," said one trader, who said there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet to come from Enron. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price11/27/2001AFX News(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News LtdNEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said. At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51.The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 points at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98. Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks. Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd. As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised. The current agreement with Dynegy contains a "material adverse change" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off. As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. "Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is," said Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co. Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse. "The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure, it could be several billion dollars," said Gheit. If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd. blms/cl/gcCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron TermsBy Carol S. Remond11/27/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)A Dow Jones Newswires Column NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader. Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take more risks, looking to place trades on the deal. "We're trying to figure out a good play," said a trader at a New York hedge fund. So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron's shares with a long position in some of its bonds. "People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it," a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, "We're still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity sides." Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price. Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market. "Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds," said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron's bonds. Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday. Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron at less than $6 a share. Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds. When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount. Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of 0.15. "A lot of the guys are still very skeptical," said a bond trader at a New York bank. "But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds." Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position. "We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive," the manager of a large New York hedge fund said. Carol S.

Dynegy Confirms Talks On Enron Deal Structure - SourceBy Christina CheddarOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES11/27/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) confirmed the company is in talks with a number of parties regarding the structure of its transaction with Enron Corp. (ENE). "I can confirm that we are in discussions with the parties involved in the transaction related to the structure of the deal," said John Sousa. "I can't elaborate any further at this time."An Enron official wasn't immediately to comment. Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report. Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shares changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%. Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dynegy share. The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to support its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, which totals about $13 billion. While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertain how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent. Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron "locked down" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses. Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said. If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from "pending"' or "threatened" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked. In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits have been filed against Enron. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.com The discussions between Enron and Dynegy aren't merely focused on revising the consideration Dynegy will pay. They are also aimed at providing Enron with additional funding and at restructuring its debt, said a person familiar with the negotiations. The moves are aimed at restoring confidence in Enron and relieving "the perceived liquidity crisis," the source said. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron shares were down 2 cents at $3.99 after rising 19 cents, or 4.7 percent, to $4.20 in early dealings on the New York Stock Exchange.Analysts questioned the viability of the original proposal for Dynegy to acquire Enron in a deal worth about $9 billion.

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit ratingwill remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody'sInvestors Service, which said it won't take any ratings actiontoday on the largest energy trading company.     David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratingscommunication, said although there was speculation in the marketthat Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't takeany action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.     Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron'scredit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for theenergy trader in private equity.     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because ofconcern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concernwas heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment duethis week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes anacquisition by Dynegy Inc.Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle2001-11-27 15:16 (New York)Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, havebeen turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.     ``I was approached by several people to invest in thecompany, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investorfrom Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a goodinvestment, he said.     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because ofconcern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concernwas heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment duethis week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes anacquisition by Dynegy Inc.     The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on itsstock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talksbetween Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transactionconvinced some investors the takeover was more likely to takeplace.     Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closedyesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. Thestock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.                        Declining to Invest     J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, planto provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billionpackage. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for morethan two weeks.     Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund thatinvests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as CarlyleGroup and Blackstone have balked at investing, said peoplefamiliar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined tocomment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``Weare not in discussions with Enron about financing.''   ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,which should reassure their trading partners,'' said KathleenVuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the StrongAmerican Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of herportfolio invested in Dynegy shares.     Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their mergerover the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegyis now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each ofEnron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or lessthan $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing peopleclose to the discussions.                               Terms     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' saidPaul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who coversthe energy market for Deutsche Bank.     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share ofDynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures aboutEnron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio wouldbe 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analystwho rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only ifEnron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, ananalyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBSWarburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earningsto 75 cents a share from $1.65.     Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion ofpayments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion incash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised theprospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's creditrating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debtrepayments for two affiliated partnerships.                           Cash Question     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position rightnow?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cashposition of the company stabilizing or not?''     Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the companyfiled a quarterly report with the Securities and ExchangeCommission last week announcing it had a $690 million note duethis week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve fromlenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 millioncredit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said hewas ``encouraged'' by the developments.Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)     Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst atLiberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed$23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.     Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets hehelps manage at Liberty.

If they wereto impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs toresuscitate Enron back to health.''A.G.

The market is waiting for confirmation and details of arenegotiated bid, Heim said.     ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heimsaid. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring upof Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for thedeal to have real value.''Commerzbank Analyst Meade Comments on Dynegy's Talks With Enron2001-11-27 10:42 (New York)     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Commerzbank Securitiesanalyst Andre Meade comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, peoplefamiliar with talks between the Houston-based companies saidyesterday. Meade rates both companies ``hold'' and owns no shares.     ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears thatEnron's crown jewel, its marketing and trading business, isdeteriorating,''      Investors are waiting for a sign on the state of thebusiness, Meade said.      Enron's trading business was worth more than $10 billionbefore partners began shunning it on credit concerns, Meade said.A lower price struck by Dynegy may reveal how much business hasfallen, and whether Dynegy believes Enron can regain it, Meadesaid.     A New York Times report that banks may extend payments onsome loans until after Dynegy purchases Enron ``raises concernthat Dynegy will be hurt by taking on the vast liabilities ofEnron,'' Meade said.ENRON SHARES RECOVER FROM A.M. SLUMPBy Lisa SandersCBS.MarketWatch.com4:10 PM ET Nov 27, 2001HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron recovered from the morning's sub-$4a share level Tuesday amid reports that the embattled energy merchant isworking with Dynegy to renegotiate its takeover offer.Enron (ENE), which once hit $84.88 during the last holiday season,added 13 cents to close at $4.14 on volume of 68.4 million shares. Thestock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock ExchangeTuesday.Dynegy shares added $1.64 to close at $40.89.The New York Times reported that Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) and Enronare renegotiating Dynegy's bid, once valued at $9 billion in stock.According to the report, Dynegy is worried that Enron's core business --energy trading -- is deteriorating. See full story.Getting it done_______________________________________________________________________Glen Hilton, portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund, saidit's a "crapshoot" as to whether the deal gets done."I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a goodposition for the long-term," he said. His fund liquidated its Enronholdings completely in mid to late-October. "Enron was the leader (inenergy trading), and it's clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shotto take up the mantle."Hilton pointed to Enron's 10-Q, filed last Monday with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, and the falling share price as potentialtriggers of the deal's material adverse affect clause. Those two thingscould very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger. If that happens,Hilton said, an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility."Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of thefew that could make something out of it," Hilton said. "If Dynegy canrestore confidence in Enron's trading business and get Northern NaturalGas, it looks like it might be worth the headache."Dynegy has the rights to Enron's Northern Natural Gas, a pipelinesystem, whether the merger goes through or not.Enron wasn't immediately available for comment. Dynegy, through acompany spokesman, confirmed that it was in discussions with "theparties involved in the transaction" related to the structure of thedeal.Top Of The News Enron In Free Fall Dan Ackman <javascript:newWindow('Ackman')>, Forbes.com <http://www.forbes.com/news>, 11.27.01, 9:00 AM ET NEW YORK - If not for Sept. 11, Enron would be a major scandal; as it stands, it's a minor scandal. The Houston-based energy company, whose Chairman Kenneth Lay is a personal friend of and top fundraiser for President George W. Bush <http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/12/gwbush.html> and Vice President Dick Cheney, is in free fall. The bailout by rival Dynegy made public three weeks ago appears to be unraveling. Dynegy's (nyse: DYN <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=DYN> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=DYN> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=DYN>) buyout of Enron (nyse: ENE <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=ENE> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=ENE> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=ENE>) was originally valued at $9 billion. But just as the deal was announced, Enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccurate and that it had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years. While the companies have not said the merger is off, investors don't believe it will happen, at least not at the stated price; they have bid Enron shares down to the point where the company has a market value of less than $3 billion. The shares closed yesterday at $4.01, down from $78 a year ago. The situation is in flux, as it has been for months. During that time, several top Enron executives have been forced to resign. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive officer, left in August for "personal reasons." Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agreement that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are sure to follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on executives, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and the exercise of stock options in 2000 alone. For now, Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival with 2000 revenue of $101 billion. Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis of confidence in Enron's reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy markets. Last year, Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electricity trading--a fast-paced, complex business quite removed from the company's history as a gas- and oil-pipeline builder and operator. The fear now is that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidation that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills. The company had $10.5 billion in debt as of its last annual report, and that number has likely grown by 20%. Already, credit agencies have cut their ratings on Enron debt. Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco (nyse: CVX <http://www.forbes.com/finance/mktguideapps/compinfo/CompanyTearsheet.jhtml?tkr=CVX> - news <http://www.forbes.com/markets/company_news.jhtml?ticker=CVX> - people <http://www.forbes.com/peopletracker/results.jhtml?startRow=0&name=&ticker=CVX>), may pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase goes through. But the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close. Investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang on by itself. Enron bills itself as one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. It says it "markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world." While all this may be true, its popularity with investors was based largely on its fast-growing revenue--much like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors. Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that revenue, and indeed Enron's own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused. Most of the revenue was generated from trading, but the company's shares sold as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm. Enron was famous for being famous. Before the start of the 2000 baseball season, it purchased the rights to have its name on Houston's new ballpark. By 2002, Enron Field may need a new name. The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy, but it means nothing. At the time the company was formed from the merger of InterNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas, the idea was to call the company Enteron. But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Enteron means "intestines;" they decided to drop the "te" in the middle and go with Enron. Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy, a much smaller company in terms of revenue. If the deal falls apart, it may want to go back to Enteron.

A lowe=r rating could hamper Enron's core trading businesses.=20Behind the worries among these agencies, in part, is the loss of investor c=onfidence, which one of the rating companies, Fitch, said in a report last =week could impair "Enron's financial flexibility and access to capital mark=ets, therefore impacting its ability to conduct its business."=20The Enron spokesman said yesterday that the company's trading partners are =doing business with Enron on "essentially the same terms" as they have in t=he past. "There has been no significant change in the credit conditions," h=e said. Trading partners demanding significantly stricter terms from Enron =would be a sign of further deteriorating confidence in the energy giant's f=inances.=20The banks involved in the current negotiations, including J.P. Morgan Chase= & Co. and Citigroup Inc., are asking Enron for stricter covenants on the n=ew credit line than they had asked for in the past, one official said.=20Bankers involved with the company say the goal of the new credit line is to= show the investment community that Enron can meet its commitments. "Confid=ence in this company was lost," said one bank official involved in the nego=tiations for a new credit line. "But confidence will be restored."=20Corporations of Enron's size commonly establish credit lines only to demons=trate to the investment community that in case of an emergency, they have a=ccess to cash. In practice, few companies actually make use of these lines.= Thus, drawing down credit lines, while providing immediate cash, also illu=strates the pressure Enron is feeling.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Or is poor Enron just misunderstood? Those a=re the questions after another week of Chinese water torture financial rele=ases from the beleaguered Houston-based energy concern.=20A year ago Enron was the hottest of the hot. While tech stocks were tanking=, Enron's shares gained 89% during 2000. Even die-hard Enron skeptics -- of= which there are many -- had to concede that last year was a barnburner for= the company. Earnings were up 25%, and revenues more than doubled.Not bad, considering where the company came from. A decade ago 80% of Enron='s revenues came from the staid (and regulated) gas-pipeline business. No l=onger. Enron has been selling those assets steadily, partly fuelling revenu=es, but also expanding into new areas. By 2000, around 95% of its revenues =and more than 80% of its profits came from trading energy, and buying and s=elling stakes in energy producers.=20The stock market applauded the move: At its peak, Enron was trading at arou=nd 55 times earnings. That's more like Cisco's once tropospheric valuation =than the meager 2.5 times earnings the market affords Enron competitor Duke= Energy.=20But Enron management wanted more. It was, after all, a "new economy" Web-ba=sed energy trader where aggressive performers were lucratively rewarded. Ac=cording to Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay, the company deserved to be value=d accordingly. At a conference early this year he told investors the compan=y's stock should be trading much higher -- say $126, more than double its p=rice then.=20Then the new economy motor stalled. The company's president left under stra=nge circumstances. And rumors swirled about Enron's machinations in Califor=nia's energy markets. Investors pored over Enron's weakening financial stat=ements. But Enron analysts must have the energy and persistence of Talmudic= scholars to penetrate the company's cryptic financials. In effect, Enron's= troubles were hiding in plain sight.=20It should have been a warning. Because of the poor financial disclosure the=re was no way to assess the damage the economy was doing to the company, or= how it was trying to make its numbers. Most analysts blithely concede that= they really didn't know how Enron made money -- in good markets or bad.=20Not that Enron didn't make money, it did -- albeit with a worrisomely low r=eturn on equity given the capital required -- but sometimes revenues came f=rom asset sales and complex off-balance sheet transactions, sometimes from =energy-trading revenues. And it was very difficult to understand why or how= -- or how likely it was Enron could do it again next quarter.=20Enron's financial inscrutability hid stranger stuff. Deep inside the compan=y filings was mention of LJM Cayman, L.P., a private investment partnership=. According to Enron's March 2000 10-K, a "senior officer of Enron is the m=anaging member" of LJM. Well, that was a puzzler. LJM was helping Enron "ma=nage price and value risk with regard to certain merchant and similar asset=s by entering into derivatives, including swaps, puts, and collars." It was=, in a phrase, Enron's house hedge fund.=20There is nothing wrong with hedging positions in the volatile energy market= -- it is crucial for a market-maker. But having an Enron executive managin=g and benefiting from the hedging is something else altogether, especially =when the Enron executive was the company's CFO, Andrew Fastow. While he sev=ered his connection with LJM (and related partnerships) in July of this yea=r -- and left Enron in a whirl of confusion last week -- the damage had bee=n done.=20As stories in this paper have since made clear, Mr. Fastow's LJM partnershi=p allegedly made millions from the conflict-ridden, board-approved LJM-Enro=n relationship. And recently Enron ended the merry affair, taking a billion=-dollar writedown against equity two weeks ago over some of LJM's wrong-foo=ted hedging. Analysts, investors, and the Securities & Exchange Commission =were left with many questions, and very few answers.=20To be fair, I suppose, Enron did disclose the LJM arrangement more than a y=ear ago, saying it had erected a Chinese wall between Fastow/LJM and the co=mpany. And in a bull market, no one paid much attention to what a bad idea =that horribly conflicted relationship was -- or questioned the strength of =the wall. Now it matters, as do other Enron-hedged financings, a number of =which look to have insufficient assets to cover debt repayments due in 2003=.=20We didn't do anything wrong is Mr. Lay's refrain in the company's current r=ound of entertainingly antagonistic conference calls. That remains to be se=en, but at the very least the company has shown terrible judgment, and hero=ic arrogance in its dismissal of shareholders interests and financial trans=parency.=20Where has Enron's board of directors been through all of this? What kind of= oversight has this motley collection of academics, government sorts, and r=etired executives exercised for Enron shareholders? Very little, it seems. =It is time Enron's board did a proper investigation, and then cleaned house= -- perhaps neatly finishing with themselves.=20---=20Mr. Kedrosky is a professor of business at the University of British Colomb=ia.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights ReservedCOMMENT & ANALYSIS - Enron flickers - Once a paragon of the new economy, th=e US energy group is under scrutiny for its opaque accounting and free-whee=ling management, write Simon London and Sheila McNulty.=20Enron has some explaining to do. For the past decade or more, the Texas-bas=ed company has basked in the admiration of investors and business school pr=ofessors eager to understand its transformation from staid utility to fast-=growing energy trader. Now it faces scrutiny of a more unwelcome kind.Its share price has been falling since the beginning of this year. The US S=ecurities and Exchange Commission is investigating multi-million dollar dea=ls with a private equity fund associated with its own chief financial offic=er, which resulted in a $1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity. A hastily=-convened conference call last week with analysts raised as many questions =as it answered about these "related-party transactions". The departure of A=ndy Fastow, the aforementioned CFO, soon followed.=20With its credit rating under review by two leading ratings agencies, Enron =has also been forced to draw down bank credit lines. Yesterday if confirmed= it was trying to establish additional lines of liquidity.=20"This marks the end of Enron's walk on the wild side," observes Curt Launer=, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, the investment bank.=20On the surface, events at Enron can be explained by the combination of dete=riorating trading conditions, a complex capital structure and poor investor= relations. But the root causes go back further. The entrepreneurial cultur=e and dynamic management that fuelled Enron's growth in the 1990s appear to= have also sown some of the seeds of the present crisis. Therein may lie a =cautionary tale for all executives trying to sprinkle "new economy" magic o=n to old economy companies.=20Enron's transformation began in earnest in 1990 with the arrival of Jeffrey= Skilling, who was hired from McKinsey, the management consulting firm, to =develop energy trading.=20For the previous decade Enron had been emerging as a force in the deregulat=ing US energy markets under the guidance of Kenneth Lay, a former deputy un=der-secretary of energy. Mr Lay remains chairman. But it was Mr Skilling wh=o spearheaded the move into trading energy as well as generating and supply=ing it.=20The two sides of the business - trading and generation/supply - have always= been strange bedfellows. The former demands an entrepreneurial spirit more= likely to be found on Wall Street than in a utility. Mr Skilling's answer =in the early 1990s was to bring in talent from outside the company. One of =his first recruits was Mr Fastow, an expert in securitisation, the repackag=ing of financial assets so they can be traded in financial markets.=20The energy trading division tried from the start to differentiate itself. A= management structure was introduced with only four layers - vice-president=, director, manager and associate/ analyst - much like a consulting firm. E=mployees were free to take as much holiday as they liked, so long as they d=elivered results. As one of Mr Skilling's early recruits recalled: "It was =all about creating an atmosphere and deliberately breaking the rules."=20The seemingly free-wheeling style was based on a "loose-tight" management m=odel expounded by Tom Peters and Bob Waterman, the management writers and M=cKinsey alumni. At Enron this meant that employees in the merchant energy b=usiness were encouraged by huge bonuses to pursue new ideas and innovate in= existing markets.=20Up-and-coming employees moved freely between projects in pursuit of glory. =Louise Kitchen, the 32-year-old British executive who was the creative forc=e behind Enron Online, the group's internet-based trading platform, changed= jobs or was promoted seven times in five years.=20Balancing these loose management practices were tight central control of ri=sk, legal commitments, finance and performance evaluation/remuneration. Mr =Skilling once described the approach in this way: "As long as you clear you=r deals or business ideas through those screens, you can do whatever you wa=nt around here."=20This approach did deliver growth and innovation. As well as making markets =in its core energy products, Enron now trades everything from weather deriv=atives - which enable companies to insure themselves against unfavourable c=limatic conditions - to broadband telecommunications capacity and metals. T=he success of Enron Online allows the group to describe itself as the world='s leading e-commerce company.=20It has also started marketing electricity to US consumers through a joint v=enture with International Business Machines and America Online, the interne=t service provider.=20In February this year Mr Skilling got his reward: he became chief executive= of a group ranked seventh in Fortune magazine's list of the 500 most power=ful US corporations - ahead of such corporate giants as IBM, AT&T, Bank of =America and Boeing.=20In retrospect, however, this breakneck pace of growth and innovation was ac=hieved at a price. First was the personal cost to Mr Skilling. In August he= abruptly resigned after only six months in the top job. Personal, non-heal=th related reasons were cited and investors have received no further explan=ation.=20A second cost was an enormous increase in financial complexity. In order to= avoid a ballooning of assets and liabilities as the group expanded, Enron =used a range of off-balance sheet vehicles to help finance expansion. LJM, =the private equity fund in which Mr Fastow played a role, is just one of a =cast of characters to be found in the footnotes to Enron's accounts. Other =financing vehicles include Osprey, Marlin, Whitewing, Atlantic Water Trust =and Azurix. "They went after too many things too quickly," says Stephen Moo=re of Moody's Investors Service, the credit ratings agency.=20A third cost, associated with the last, was a loss of financial transparenc=y. The group's extensive use of swaps, options and other derivative financi=al instruments in its merchant energy business means that investors have li=ttle idea of how Enron actually makes its money - or the underlying risks t=o which it is exposed.=20David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, summed up the views of many i=nvestors during last week's conference call. He told the group's management=: "The company's credibility is being severely questioned and there is a ne=ed for much more disclosure. There is an appearance that you are hiding som=ething or that there is something going on beneath the surface that may be =questionable."=20The fourth cost was a loss of strategic focus. "The problems, in our view, =stem from Enron venturing too aggressively in areas outside of its core ski=lls," argues Raymond Niles, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "Power plants =in India, water companies, extension of their franchise to the mass retail =market, and using a fibre-optic network to deliver content over the interne=t are all unrelated, or only tangentially related, to their core merchant e=nergy business."=20Enron executives also appeared to get carried away with the prospects for s=ome of these ventures. This time last year Mr Skilling was arguing that Enr=on Broadband was a business worth $35bn ( #24bn) in its own right. This hel=ped push the share price to all-time highs - and storing up trouble when tr=ading volumes failed to materialise.=20"They over-promised on the new business they created," says Chris Bartlett,= a professor at Harvard Business School and long-time watcher of the compan=y. "Enron was trying to ride the dotcom bubble with Enron Online and the br=oadband business. To some extent they are now paying the price."=20Will Enron weather the storm? Notwithstanding the risk of further out-of-th=e-blue financial shocks, most analysts believe that it will. The merchant e=nergy business remains powerful and profitable. Mr Niles at Salomon Smith B=arney points out that this side of the group drives more than 80 per cent o=f earnings and has shown consistent 30-40 per cent annual growth over the p=ast three years. Assets totalling more than $4bn were also earmarked for di=sposal before the current crisis erupted, underlining that there is plenty =of realisable value within the group's portfolio of physical energy assets.==20And yet the doubts remain. It is, ultimately, a question of confidence and =credibility. Investors suspect that the balance between loose and tight man=agement methods has tilted too far towards the former.

OPPEL Jr.10/28/2001The New York TimesPage 1, Column 2c. 2001 New York Times CompanyIS time running out for Enron?=20At the beginning of this year, the Enron Corporation, the world's dominant =energy trader, appeared unstoppable. The company's decade-long effort to pe=rsuade lawmakers to deregulate electricity markets had succeeded from Calif=ornia to New York. Its ties to the Bush administration assured that its vie=ws would be heard in Washington. Its sales, profits and stock were soaring.And under the leadership of Jeffrey K. Skilling, its chief executive, Enron='s arrogance had grown even more quickly.=20The company, based in Houston, dripped contempt for the regulators and cons=umer groups that stood between it and fully deregulated markets -- for elec=tricity, water and everything else. Everyone would win under deregulation, =Enron said -- especially its shareholders, whose stock would soar as the co=mpany profited from creating new markets.=20''We are on the side of angels,'' Mr. Skilling said in March, dismissing th=ose who saw the company as a profiteer in California's energy crisis. ''Peo=ple want to have open, competitive markets. They want fair competition. It'=s the American way.''=20But less than a year later, everybody seems to have lost, especially Enron'=s investors. Enron's stock is plunging, and questions about its finances ar=e mounting.=20Some experts in the energy industry worry that if the crisis at the company= worsens, trading in natural gas and electricity could be seriously disrupt=ed and energy prices could grow more volatile. In a worst-case outlook, Enr=on could become the 2001 version of Long-Term Capital Management, the huge =hedge fund whose collapse roiled financial markets during the fall of 1998.= Enron's shares have fallen more than 80 percent this year, erasing $50 bil=lion in shareholder value.=20Enron closed on Friday at $15.40, down 95 cents, after hitting a 52-week lo=w of $15.04 earlier in the day.=20The future of electricity deregulation is in doubt, thanks to blackouts and= soaring power prices in California earlier this year -- a crisis that ende=d only when that state contradicted deregulation's basic tenets by interven=ing deeply in the power market. Enron's efforts to become a profit-making w=ater supplier and to create a new market in broadband communications capaci=ty have been expensive failures. In August, Mr. Skilling quit, forcing Kenn=eth L. Lay, his predecessor as chief executive and still Enron's chairman, =to resume day-to-day control of the company.=20The company declined to make senior executives, including Mr. Lay, availabl=e for comment, and asked that questions be submitted in writing. Mr. Skilli=ng could not be reached.=20Enron's problems boiled over earlier this month, when it disclosed that its= shareholders' equity, a measure of the company's value, dropped by $1.2 bi=llion in the last quarter because of a deal disclosed only very hazily in E=nron's regular financial statements. The Securities and Exchange Commission= is looking into the company's financial reporting, and some investors ques=tion whether Enron has overstated profits at its primary business of tradin=g electricity and natural gas.=20THE slump in the company's shares accelerated after Enron revealed the fall= in its shareholders' equity. On Wednesday, the company forced out its chie=f financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who is at the center of the controve=rsy over Enron's confusing finances. The company, which six months ago seem=ed to be reaping billions of dollars from California's energy crisis, today= faces a potential cash crunch.=20The surprise about shareholder equity inflamed investors' smoldering concer=n about Enron's opaque financial statements. Now, with Wall Street analysts= and bond-rating agencies demanding more information about the complex tran=sactions that have fueled the company's profits, Enron has been reduced to =issuing news releases assuring investors that it has adequate access to cas=h.=20Enron does not appear to be in immediate danger of running out of cash. On =Thursday, the company drew down a $3.3 billion credit line it had previousl=y arranged with a group of banks led by Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, w=hich have each extended at least $400 million. But because of Enron's impor=tance in the natural gas and electricity markets, industry experts say that= any problem at the company could disrupt energy trading nationwide.=20The supply of natural gas and electricity would probably not be affected ev=en if the company failed, because Enron is mainly a trader, rather than a p=roducer, of energy. But a crisis at the company might increase the volatili=ty of energy prices, which have swung wildly in the last year.=20Philip K. Verleger Jr., an energy-markets economist, emphasized that he tho=ught Enron would survive this crisis. But he said it was not clear what wou=ld happen if Enron ran out of cash or if traders that use the company's Enr=onOnline Internet trading marketplace defaulted on their obligations.=20''You suddenly have all these positions they have taken on there -- are the=y good? Are the firm's hedges good? What's the situation?'' Mr. Verleger sa=id. ''It's got everyone scared.''=20In the short run, Enron's credit rating may be its biggest problem. If the =company's rating falls below investment grade, Enron could be forced to iss=ue tens of millions of shares of stock to cover loans that it has guarantee=d. But creating new shares would make the shares that already exist less va=luable, because those shares would no longer represent full ownership of th=e company.=20A drop in the company's credit rating could also prompt other energy trader=s and producers to back away from doing business with Enron, hurting the co=mpany's sales and profits.=20Enron's credit rating stands several notches above the critical point. But =its bonds, which are publicly traded, have fallen so low that they are now =offering interest rates of almost 10 percent, comparable with many junk bon=ds. Two of the three major credit-rating agencies, Moody's Investors Servic=e and Fitch Investors Service, have put Enron's bonds on review for possibl=e downgrades.=20''The issue that's in the front of everybody's mind right now is credit,'' =said Mark Gurley, senior vice president and general manager for trading at =Aquila Inc., one of the nation's largest energy traders. Aquila is based in= Kansas City, Mo.=20For now, Aquila and other major energy traders and producers, including Rel=iant Energy, the El Paso Corporation and Dynegy, are continuing to do busin=ess with Enron. And Mr. Gurley said that Enron's own trading in the electri=city and natural gas markets did not suggest the sort of frenzied selling r=eminiscent of the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.=20''They haven't done anything trading-wise that gives me any indication they= are closing their books down,'' he said.=20Still, some executives at other companies said they were looking more caref=ully at transactions with Enron, especially long-term contracts. They also =said risk-management and credit officers were calling each other regularly =to discuss the situation.=20Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, said on Friday that no energy-trading comp=any had stopped doing business with Enron. He declined to say whether any o=f the company's trading partners had suspended or altered credit terms. He =said the company was continuing to see normal volumes of business.=20But the crisis that Enron will face if its credit rating is downgraded is j=ust a symptom of the bigger problem the company must confront. For years, t=he details of Enron's finances have been a mystery even to the Wall Street =analysts whose job it is to follow the company, and to the investors who ow=n its stock and bonds. When Enron's profits were soaring and it was creatin=g lucrative new markets, shareholders did not seem to care about the impene=trability of its financial statements.=20Now they do. Yet the company seems incapable of offering straight answers t=o the questions investors ask.=20To others in the industry, the opaqueness of the company's financial statem=ents parallels Enron's efforts to keep its energy-trading business lightly =regulated and free of disclosure requirements. Though they do not expect En=ron to crumble like Long-Term Capital Management, they say that, like the g=iant hedge fund, Enron uses a lot of debt, regulatory oversight is limited =and outsiders have a difficult time figuring out its finances.=20The most pressing concerns are a series of partnerships and trusts Enron cr=eated to move some of its assets and debt off its balance sheet. With names= like Marlin and Osprey, the partnerships have at least $3.3 billion in bon=ds outstanding, backed by assets like a stake in Azurix, Enron's water comp=any subsidiary. Enron has promised that if the partnerships' debts exceed t=he value of their assets, Enron will issue enough new shares to make up the= difference.=20DEALS with partnerships formed by Mr. Fastow, who was chief financial offic=er when they were organized, led to the $1.2 billion write-off in sharehold=ers' equity that Enron announced last week. The company has offered only sk=impy details of its transactions with those partnerships.=20Enron ended its relationships with those partnerships in the last quarter, =after being criticized by shareholders. In the process, it wrote off a prom=issory note that it had carried on its books, reducing its shareholders' eq=uity by $1.2 billion. But, because of complex accounting rules, the transac=tion was not apparent in Enron's quarterly earnings report.=20The transaction disturbs investors because it suggests that Enron may have =found a way to hide losses, throwing the accuracy of its financial statemen=ts into question. When Enron released third-quarter earnings on Oct. 16, it= reported a loss from $1 billion in write-offs on failed investments. The e=arnings statement did not mention the additional $1.2 billion equity write-=down. But the company said its core business had been solidly profitable, a=nd its shares rose.=20In a conference call with analysts after the announcement, Mr. Lay, Enron's= chairman, also disclosed the reduction in shareholder equity. The referenc=e was a brief one, however, and some listeners did not catch it. Those anal=ysts were angered when they found out the next day what Enron had done, and= many were confused by the accounting procedure. Enron's stock began to sli=de, and investors clamored for more information about the write-off. But so= far, the company's efforts to clear up the situation have further unnerved= investors.=20Mr. Lay has met with investors during the last two weeks to try to explain =the deals, but some on Wall Street say they have come away with doubts abou=t Mr. Lay's grasp of the situation. They say that the two people at Enron w=ho appear to have been most knowledgeable about the deals -- Mr. Skilling a=nd Mr. Fastow -- have both left the company.=20In an interview in late August, Mr. Lay said he did not know some details a=bout the deals involving Mr. Fastow. In response to one question about them=, he said, ''You're getting way over my head.''=20Mr. Palmer of Enron disputed any suggestion that Mr. Lay did not have a gra=sp of the investments at issue, saying Mr. Lay was handicapped in talking a=bout them because of the S.E.C. investigation. ''There is not a whole lot w=e can say, or should say, about them,'' Mr. Palmer said. He also said the c=ompany expected to generate about $3 billion in cash through asset sales by= the end of next year.=20In a conference call on Tuesday, analysts pressed Mr. Lay and other top Enr=on executives to reveal more information about the LJM write-down and its o=ther partnerships. Instead, they offered only vague explanations of the dea=l, leaving Wall Street worried that more write-offs might be coming.=20David Fleischer, a Goldman, Sachs analyst and a longtime supporter of the c=ompany, was among those who came away concerned. ''If Enron is unable to cl=arify its off-balance-sheet transactions and restore confidence in the very= near term by assuring investors that no more surprises are forthcoming tha=t would affect the balance sheet or liquidity position, then the company wi=ll likely lose access to the capital markets,'' he wrote in a research note= after the call.=20To try to reassure investors, Enron said late Thursday that EnronOnline, it=s Internet-based trading exchange, executed more than 8,400 trades that day=, a higher-than-normal volume.=20''We know we have our work cut out for us if we are to rebuild our credibil=ity with the investment community -- and we're working on that,'' Mr. Lay s=aid in a statement. ''But in the meantime, the best evidence of our strengt=h is the willingness of customers to bring their business to Enron.''=20But those reassurances apparently are no longer enough for Wall Street. Enr=on's stock tumbled almost 6 percent Friday, to its lowest levels in six yea=rs.=20Now analysts are scrambling to figure out the extent of Enron's off-balance=-sheet debt and to assess the risk that the company will have to issue new =shares to make good on its partnership guarantees.=20Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities in Houston, calculates tha=t Enron may have close to $9 billion in off-balance-sheet debt. She said th=at Enron had for two years been trying to sell about $6 billion in foreign =assets -- including properties in Latin America and a power plant in India =embroiled in a dispute with the state government -- and she worries about t=hose prospects for sale in light of Enron's problems and the souring econom=y.=20''As Enron is forced to sell assets to keep the ratings agencies off their =backs, they may have to write those assets down,'' Ms. Coale said. On Wedne=sday, she downgraded her rating on Enron to ''sell'' from ''neutral.''=20''The bottom line is, it's really difficult to recommend an investment when= management does not disclose the facts,'' Ms. Coale said.=20Short-sellers, who attacked Enron's accounting even before the company disc=losed the write-off, say the company's problems may run even deeper than an=alysts fear. Enron may have used the partnerships not just to finance money=-losing investments but to hide losses in its core trading business, they s=ay.=20''The company still isn't disclosing enough to know whether the core busine=ss, the trading business, is profitable,'' said Mark Roberts, director of r=esearch at Off Wall Street, which recommended shorting Enron's stock on May= 7, when it stood at $59.43. ''The issue remains: why are they doing these =transactions? Our theory has been that the core operations aren't that prof=itable.''=20James Chanos, a leading short-seller who has bet that Enron's stock will fa=ll, said, ''Is Enron booking gains when it has real profits, but hiding the= losses when deals go against it?'' Mr. Palmer of Enron said the company st=ood by its reported energy-trading profits.=20Even traders at other energy companies say they do not have a clear picture= of Enron's positions. Enron maintains that it is in no danger of being wip=ed out by a sharp move in electricity or gas prices because it keeps its tr=ading book balanced -- meaning the energy it has agreed to sell is offset, =in roughly equivalent amounts, by energy it has agreed to buy.=20''With these guys, they tell us -- and all you've got is their word -- that= they're hedged,'' said Mr. Verleger, the economist.=20IN fact, Enron has lobbied forcefully over the years to limit regulation an=d disclosure of its trading operations. Last year, the company successfully= lobbied Congress to effectively ensure that its Internet-trading platform =would be exempted from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commissi=on.=20Enron and other power traders do file limited information in reports to the= Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the agency that oversees wholesale e=lectricity and natural gas markets. But the commission does not keep track =of specific transactions and prices.=20Large-scale energy trading has existed for only about a half-dozen years. E=nron pioneered the business, and now dominates it, accounting for about one=-quarter of all trading in the United States.=20Before Congress and federal regulators opened up the market for wholesale e=lectricity, a process that began in earnest a decade ago, the power busines=s was a simpler affair. Utilities were given areas of monopoly service, and= their rates -- and ability to deliver enough electricity -- were overseen =by state regulators. But with the move to deregulate the business, independ=ent and unregulated generators and traders have flourished, providing an ev=er-growing portion of the nation's power.=20Beginning in the 1980's, the sale and transportation of natural gas was als=o deregulated, spurring Enron, which used to be primarily a gas-pipeline co=mpany, to move into the trading business.=20The company's shift to trading gas and electricity accelerated in the mid-1=990's, with the ascension of Mr. Skilling, who became chief executive in Fe=bruary, just six months before his unexpected resignation. Underscoring the= change in direction, in securities filings this year Enron described its p=rincipal business as ''security brokers, dealers and flotation.'' Before, i=t had said it was in the business of ''wholesale-petroleum and petroleum pr=oducts.''=20For most of its ascent, Enron reported outstanding profit figures and Wall =Street accepted them with pleasure. A year ago, when it disclosed the first= transactions with partnerships led by Mr. Fastow, the company's former chi=ef financial officer, analysts who asked questions were told that the deals= were routine and were being disclosed only because of Mr. Fastow's involve=ment.=20Enron does not appear to face an immediate cash crunch. But the bank credit= lines that it drew on last week to pay off its short-term debt will have t=o be renegotiated next spring. The controversial partnerships do not have t=o pay their debts until the following year -- unless Enron loses its invest=ment-grade credit rating before that.=20ENRON will also need to maintain its large trading positions, which could s=uffer if participants in those markets grow more nervous about Enron's cred=it. When Long-Term Capital was stumbling in 1998, some Wall Street rivals s=old the securities they thought Long-Term owned, trying to force Long-Term =to sell its positions quickly and at a loss. Something similar in energy ma=rkets might be possible. If so, Enron might find, as Long-Term did, that po=sitions that should offset each other do not.=20Enron's new chief financial officer may yet persuade investors that in fact= the company's profits are real, and that its condition is better than the =short-sellers believe. As questions are answered, confidence, and the share= price, could rebound.=20But for now, investors are skittish, and some competitors are eager to take= advantage of Enron's plight.Photos: Enron, which is building a new headquarters in Houston, grew with d=eregulation.

All Rights Reserved. =09Money and Business/Financial Desk; Section 3Plumbing Mystery Of Deals By EnronBy FLOYD NORRIS10/28/2001The New York TimesPage 13, Column 6c. 2001 New York Times CompanyAT the heart of the sudden collapse in investor confidence in the Enron Cor=poration are unusual trades it entered into with partnerships led by its ch=ief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, beginning in the summer of 1999. B=ecause they were transactions among related parties, the company was requir=ed to disclose them, but the disclosures raised as many questions as they a=nswered. Following are some questions that investors are asking, and the cu=rrently available answers.=20Q. Why did Enron enter into the deals?A. Enron's first disclosures, in 1999, gave no reason. In later reports, it= said it was seeking to ''hedge certain merchant investments and other asse=ts,'' by which it apparently meant investments in technology and telecommun=ications companies.=20Q. How did those investments do?=20A. It looks as if they plunged in value, although there is no clear disclos=ure on that.=20Q. Why can't that be discerned?=20A. The company never said just what the investments were. And the transacti=ons with the partnerships were complicated, involving a variety of derivati=ve securities, Enron stock and various promissory notes. Enron's financial =disclosures do not provide enough information to understand the arrangement=s completely.=20Q. Why were they so complicated?=20A. One reason may have been to use accounting rules to its advantage. One a=ccounting rule dictates that companies may not record profits or losses on =transactions in their own stock. If a company sells its shares at $10 each =and then buys them back -- whether for $1 or $50 -- there is no gain or los=s. But shareholder equity does go up or down on the balance sheet -- in tha=t case reflecting how much extra cash the company took in, or paid out, on =the transactions. Enron's transactions appear to have been structured to fa=ll under that rule.=20Q. Who made money from these transactions?=20A. Enron reported some profits along the way from the deals, although not a=ll of the profits were spelled out in its quarterly filings. And it appears= that the partnerships distributed money to investors.=20Q. If the deals began in 1999, why all the uproar now?=20A. Many investors and analysts were not curious about them when everything =seemed to be going well. As long as Enron was exceeding its forecasted prof=its each quarter, they were willing to assume that what was not being discl=osed was not really important.=20Q. When were concerns raised with Enron?=20A. The complaints grew as Enron's share price fell earlier this year. By th=is summer, Enron decided that Mr. Fastow would sell his stake in the partne=rships. Then, because the partnerships would no longer be considered relate=d to Enron, the company would no longer have to disclose anything about the= transactions. But investors were still worried, and Enron later closed out= its deals with the partnerships.=20Q. How did Enron do?=20A. Badly. It took a $35 million loss, which, given the size of the transact=ions involved and the previous profits taken, was not very much. But it als=o reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.=20Q. How did that happen?=20A. That, like so much else, is not clear. But it looks as if the partnershi=p owed Enron that much money, could not pay and was let off the hook by Enr=on. In return, Enron terminated ''previously recorded contractual obligatio=ns to deliver Enron shares in future periods.'' Enron treated that like a s=hare buyback, even though the shares in question had not been issued, and d=etermined that there was no need to treat it as a loss that would reduce re=ported earnings.=20Q. Is that legal under the accounting rules?=20A. Presumably it is. But Enron's limited disclosures make it impossible to =say for sure. Enron may have discovered ways to use the accounting rules to= enable it to keep losses off income statements, while leaving profits on t=hem. That may become clearer when the Securities and Exchange Commission, w=hich has begun preliminary inquiries, completes its work. FLOYD NORRISCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The F.B.=I. has proved more effective in waging turf battles against Rudy Giuliani t=han waging war on terrorism. Of the more than 900 suspects arrested, exactl=y zero have been criminally charged in the World Trade Center attack (thoug=h one has died of natural causes, we're told, in a New Jersey jail cell). T=he Bush team didn't fully recognize that a second attack on America had beg=un until more than a week after the first casualty. The most highly trumpet=ed breakthrough in the hunt for anthrax terrorists -- Tom Ridge's announcem=ent that ''the site where the letters were mailed'' had been found in New J=ersey -- proved a dead end. And now the president is posing with elementary=-school children again.Given that this is the administration that was touted as being run with C.E=.O. clockwork, perhaps it should be added to the growing list of Things Tha=t Have Changed Forever since Sept. 11. But let's not be so hasty. Not every=thing changes that fast -- least of all Washington. The White House's home-=front failures are not sudden, unpredictable products of wartime confusion =but direct products of an ethos that has been in place since Jan. 20.=20This is an administration that will let its special interests -- particular=ly its high-rolling campaign contributors and its noisiest theocrats of the= right -- have veto power over public safety, public health and economic pr=udence in war, it turns out, no less than in peacetime. When anthrax struck=, the administration's first impulse was not to secure as much Cipro as spe=edily as possible to protect Americans, but to protect the right of pharmac=eutical companies to profiteer. The White House's faith in tax cuts as a pa=nacea for all national ills has led to such absurdities as this week's Hous=e ''stimulus'' package showering $254 million on Enron, the reeling Houston= energy company (now under S.E.C. investigation) that has served as a Bush =campaign cash machine.=20Airport security, which has been enhanced by at best cosmetic tweaks since =Sept. 11, is also held hostage by campaign cash: As Salon has reported, Ser=viceMaster, a supplier of the low-wage employees who ineptly man the gates,= is another G.O.P. donor. Not that Republicans stand alone in putting fat c=ats first. In a display of bipartisanship, Democrats -- lobbied by Linda Ha=ll Daschle, the Senate majority leader's wife -- joined the administration =in handing the airlines a $15 billion bailout that enforces no reduction in= the salaries of the industry's C.E.O.'s even as they lay off tens of thous=ands of their employees.=20To see how the religious right has exerted its own distortions on homeland =security, you also have to consider an administration pattern that goes bac=k to its creation -- and one that explains the recent trials of poor Tom Ri=dge.=20Mr. Ridge is by all accounts a capable leader -- a successful governor of a= large state (Pennsylvania) who won the Bronze Star for heroism in Vietnam.= A close friend of George W. Bush, he should have been in the administratio=n from the get-go, and was widely rumored to be a candidate for various job=s, including the vice presidency. But after being pilloried by the right be=cause he supports abortion rights, he got zilch. Instead of Mr. Ridge, the =administration signed on the pro-life John Ashcroft and Tommy Thompson -- w=ho have brought us where we are today.=20The farcical failures of these two cabinet secretaries are not merely those= of public relations -- though Mr. Thompson often comes across as a Chamber= of Commerce glad-hander who doesn't know his pants are on fire, and Mr. As=hcroft often shakes as if he's not just seen great Caesar's ghost but perha=ps John Mitchell's as well. Both have a history of letting politics overrid=e public policy that dates to the start of the administration. They've seen= no reason to reverse their partisan priorities even at a time when the pat=riotic duty of effectively fighting terror should be their No. 1 concern.==20Pre-Sept. 11, Mr. Thompson, in defiance of science, heartily lent his credi=bility to the Bush administration's stem cell ''compromise'' by going along= with its overstatement of the viability and diversity of the stem cell lin=es it would deliver to researchers. Post-Sept. 11, he destroyed his credibi=lity by understating the severity of the anthrax threat, also in defiance o=f science. Now he maintains that the $1.5 billion the administration is req=uesting to plug the many holes in our public health system -- almost all of= it earmarked for stockpiling pharmaceuticals, not shoring up local hospita=ls -- is adequate for fighting bioterrorism. This, too, is in defiance of a=ll expert estimates, including that of the one physician in the Senate, the= Republican Bill Frist.=20It should also be on Mr. Thompson's conscience that for the first two weeks= of the anthrax crisis he kept the federal government's house physician -- =David Satcher, the surgeon general and a much-needed honest broker of publi=c health -- locked away, presumably because Dr. Satcher, a Clinton appointe=e, became persona non grata in the Bush administration for issuing a June r=eport on teenage sexuality that angered the religious right. Only after Mr.= Ridge arrived on the scene was the surgeon general liberated from the gula=g.=20As for Mr. Ashcroft, he has gone so far as to turn away firsthand informati=on about domestic terrorism for political reasons. Planned Parenthood, whic=h has been on the front lines of anthrax scares for years and has by grim n=ecessity marshaled the medical and security expertise to combat them, has s=ought a meeting with the attorney general since he took office but has neve=r been granted one. This was true not only before Sept. 11 but, says Ann Gl=azier, Planned Parenthood's director of security, remains true -- even thou=gh her organization, long targeted by such home-grown Talibans as the Army =of God, has a decade's worth of leads on ''the convergence of international= and domestic terrorism.''=20Ms. Glazier found the sight of Mr. Ashcroft and other federal Keystone Kops= offering a $1 million reward for anthrax terrorists a laughable indication= of how little grasp they have of the enemy. ''Religious extremists don't r=espond to money,'' she points out. Such is the state of the F.B.I., she add=s, that one agent told a clinic to hold onto a suspect letter for a couple =of days ''because we have so many here we're afraid we're going to lose it'=' (perhaps among the Timothy McVeigh documents).=20If either the attorney general or the secretary of health and human service=s inspired anything like the confidence that, say, Mayor Giuliani does, the=re wouldn't have been a need to draft Mr. Ridge. Even so, he's mainly a P.R=. gimmick -- a man who should have been in the administration in the first =place reduced to serving as a fig leaf for lightweights. As director of hom=eland security, he's allegedly charged with supervising nearly 50 governmen=t agencies -- so far with roughly a dozen staff members. When asked to defi=ne Mr. Ridge's responsibilities, Ari Fleischer said on Wednesday that it wa=s ''a very busy coordination job,'' but so far Mr. Ridge is mainly sowing s=till more confusion.=20The one specific duty that he has claimed -- in an interview with Tom Broka=w -- was that he'd be the one ''making the phone call'' to the president to= shoot down any commercial airliner turned into a flying bomb by hijackers.= That presumably comes as news to Donald Rumsfeld, who made no provision fo=r any homeland security czar in the Air Force chain of command he publicly =codified days after Mr. Ridge's appointment.=20Since the administration tightly metes out the news from Afghanistan, we ca=n only hope that the war there is being executed more effectively than the =war here -- even as Mr. Rumsfeld and his generals now tell us that the Tali=ban, once expected to implode in days, are proving Viet-Cong-like in their =intractability. The Wall Street Journal also reported this week that ''inst=ead of a thankful Afghan population, popular support for the Taliban appear=s to be solidifying and anger with the U.S. growing.''=20Maybe we're losing that battle for Afghan hearts and minds in part because =the Bush State Department appointee in charge of the propaganda effort is a= C.E.O. (from Madison Avenue) chosen not for her expertise in policy or pol=itics but for her salesmanship on behalf of domestic products like Head & S=houlders shampoo.

City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron Corp. The water corporation, known as "the Hawk," voted 5-0 to grant the contract. If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant expansion for $32 million. But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds itself. The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could cost about $2 billion to implement. City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee this contract. The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. "In my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who will do it," Robinson said. The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council members to switch the contract to it. Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the Hawk procedures as well. John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman David Berg complaining of the "deleterious economic effect" on Azurix of the board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the job. Berg didn't do so. Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project Financial Times; May 15, 2001By ROBIN ALLENThere are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of "selling" at least part of its shareholding. The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. The project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a large-scale project, especially in the early stages. Dolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific North Field to Abu Dhabi. Qatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. "If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable" for western energy majors, asked one senior western diplomat, "then why are the serious US energy majors not involved?" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy Copyright: The Financial Times LimitedJAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). "If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per year," Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high electricity rates. A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the international market. Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating its market in 1998. These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. "The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California," Kean said. North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process he said held many benefits. Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts said at an industry seminar Tuesday. The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in March 2000.However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies. "What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly," said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the University of Tokyo. Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users. "There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization," Hatta said. He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered once the prices are liberalized. "If power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using electricity." Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. (ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries following the liberalization. Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called "Reassessing Power Deregulation," which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. Hatta of the University of Tokyo said "it's very wise" that Japan has begun the deregulation with the "bilateral supply, or trade" system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly. Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers, Hatta said. Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates - regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs are levied on prices. "There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices" nationwide, Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with "strong back-up" from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. "Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select independent power providers," Omuro said. -By Maki Aoto, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; maki.aoto@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.By Cameron Dueck05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and bankers say. But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity across Asia, they say. It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security offered by government payment guarantees. "Independant power producers (IPPs) will see Enron and Dabhol as an illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging market, but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be adversely affected because of it," said Philip Jackson, a banker with JP Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills. MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron. The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the $48.2 million outstanding. The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to MSEB if the dispute is not resolved. Local media reports earlier in May said Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital expenditure. Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or even changes in market conditions. But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient enough to back these agreements. Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they said. "Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're even more so," said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in Singapore. "If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad." Robert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy away from emerging Asian nations. "Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to call in a government guarantee," Booth said.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Saudi Won't Announce Winners Of Gas Projs Tue - Report05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported. The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers."Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with recommendations from the technical committee," the sources said, according to the newspaper. However, the oil council "might endorse some balances concerning the offers," the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further. Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas projects. Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas enhancement. After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and the oil companies in the past year, several companies were shortlisted for each project. The companies shortlisted for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development were Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E). For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were shortlisted. And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were shortlisted. -By Abdulla Fardan, Dow Jones Newswires; 973-530758; abdullah.fardan@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

MSEB refutes allegations by Enron, DPCGirish Kuber05/15/2001The Economic TimesCopyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)MUMBAI THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board on Monday in a letter to Enron refuted all allegations made against it by the company while invoking the political force majeure.Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on April 9 had invoked the political force majeure clause. DPC had indicated it was not in a position to fulfil its contractual obligations to MSEB because of political circumstances beyond its control. MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political circumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure. "Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related security documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our rights'," DPC had said. However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was uncalled for. For DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events occurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. MSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday. The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, which had been subjected to "concerted, deliberate and politically motivated actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform obligations under PPA". "Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that the political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for providing that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in protecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights," the statement added. However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs 402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply electricity as per the agreement. MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on Enron for not supplying electricity as per demand. MSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs 213 crore.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Saudi Supreme Petrol Council meeting to decide on huge gas project bids05/15/2001Business RecorderCopyright (C) 2001 Business Recorder; Source: World Reporter (TM)RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday. "The SPC has been discussing recommendations by the negotiating committee about the bids, and the meetings will continues executive president of the committee Abdulrahman al-Suhaibani told AFP. "It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final decision will be issued," added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon. The meetings began two weeks ago.A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. "The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early next week," the executive told AFP. The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, Conocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been shortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the executive said. Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic metres).-AFPCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But the announcement, and the signing of memorandums of understanding early next month, will mark only the beginning of serious negotiations on terms for the three ventures, which together will need investment of some $25 billion. It will be months before final agreements are signed."We expect to have an agreement -- a final agreement -- signed somewhere at the end of the year, or, hopefully, the first quarter of next year," said Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi in an interview last week. Saudi Arabia's 11-member Supreme Petroleum Council is expected to meet today to endorse the companies recommended by a ministerial committee led by Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. In the following week, Saudi Arabia is expected to communicate its decision to the oil companies from both sides of the Atlantic that have been vying for a role in the three projects. By the end of the month, the chosen consortium members and Saudi officials are expected to agree on which three companies will lead the projects. This will be a prestigious role in a country that is the world's largest oil exporter, has more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves and has the fifth-largest reserves of natural gas. As with any negotiations for such huge projects, industry rumors abound. All three so-called oil supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group and BP PLC -- have been mentioned as project leaders, particularly for the plum Ghawar project, named after the world's largest onshore oil field, whose environs are expected to yield large volumes of gas. The Ghawar project, known as Core Venture 1, is projected to require about $15 billion in investment. Core Venture 2 is on the Red Sea coast. The third project is in Shaybah, a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's Empty Quarter, a southeastern region bordering the United Arab Emirates. The companies say they have no idea who will be named to the consortia, or who the Saudis will choose from a short list of 11 companies -- Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, Chevron Corp., TotalFinaElf SA, ENI SpA, Enron Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Marathon Oil Canada Inc., Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Corp. -- to lead each project. But they all have their hopes. "We would be very disappointed if we are not the lead operator" for the Shaybah project, said Archie Dunham, Conoco's chairman and chief executive. Since Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invited major oil companies to return to the kingdom in October 1998, negotiations have focused on such broad issues as the scope of the projects and their integrated nature -- from exploration and production of gas to the making of petrochemicals and electricity -- as well as the notion that the companies will need adequate returns on their investment. Soon, the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as the roles to be played by national champions Aramco and petrochemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corp. --- Alexei Barrionuevo in Houston contributed to this article. --- Population PressureSaudi Arabia is opening up its energy sector, in a bid to bolster the economy as population grows-- Population21.3 million (growing over 3.5% per year)-- Unemployment rate*27%-35% of males-- Real GDP Growth Rate7.6%-- Oil Production9.3 million barrels per day-- Natural-Gas Reserves204.5 trillion cubic feet-- Natural-Gas Production/Consumption1.68 trillion cubic feet*Unofficial estimate for 1999Note: Figures are estimates for 2000 except natural-gas production,which is for 1999Source: U.S. Energy Information AdministrationCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Cheney task force seeks input from interest groupsBy SHARON THEIMERAssociated Press Writer05/14/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House team developing a national energy plan has met with more than 130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions often at odds with Republicans to major Bush supporters given private sessions with Vice President Dick Cheney. The vice president, Cabinet secretaries and others on a special task force have solicited ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage a free exchange of ideas.The White House has declined to provide names of participants - even to Congress. But interviews with participants detail a massive outreach where diverse interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist. Cheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both GOP donors. Houston-based Enron is the world's top buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. "The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have a huge host of companies come through the door. They have told us to work through our associations to the extent we can," said Don Duncan, vice president of government relations for Phillips Petroleum Co. Participants said the meetings, typically 20 minutes to 45 minutes, included about a dozen to 100 interest group members and a few task force members and staff. No details were disclosed. Instead, administration representatives summarized the nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered background and proposals. Many sent detailed materials to the task force outlining their priorities. At a half-hour meeting in late March with White House strategist Karl Rove and Bush economic adviser Larry Lindsey, nuclear energy executives tried to make sure the two knew about the production records the industry has set over the past few years. At one point, Rove asked if anyone was looking to build a nuclear power plant. An executive with Exelon replied that his company was thinking about it, meeting participants said. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has attended several meetings, including one with Teamsters President James Hoffa and an hourlong session in California with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who contends the administration has done little to help the power-strapped state. Like other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's power crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it and possible solutions. "They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever affecting the state, with a massive ripple effect for the nation," Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. "I think it demands more attention than a one-page memo." Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been studying the California problem almost daily. At a meeting between Abraham and about 100 coal industry representatives in late April, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined national energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals. "I thought the purpose was one, to reassure people in the coal industry that coal was going to play a large role in the energy mix, and essentially when the plan is unveiled that they're going to be looking to people to help martial this through Congress," said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United Mineworkers Union. White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage lobbying and that task force members were carefully instructed on what was permissible under federal law. Cheney's meetings included Enron, Edison Electric Institute, California Republicans, and the senators from Nevada, home to the proposed Yucca Mountain federal nuclear waste site. The vice president plans to meet with the renewable-energy industry this week. Enron ranked among Bush's top 10 presidential campaign contributors, giving more than $110,000, and helped sponsor a $7 million party fund-raiser last month. The Edison Electric Institute gave Republican candidates more than two-thirds of its $193,000 in contributions last year. Edison International, whose holdings include the Southern California Edison electric utility, is also a major donor, giving $535,000 to Republicans last year and $330,000 to Democrats. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Cheney met with Enron executives because the power wholesaler is a respected member of the industry, not because it was a contributor. Enron wants the administration's energy plan to ease electricity transmission bottlenecks, give companies incentives to invest in new transmission and make the wholesale power market as open as possible, he said. Tom Kuhn, the institute's president, said it is "totally ludicrous" to think political donations played a role. Cheney's meeting with Edison board members, held at the institute's invitation, lasted 15 minutes to 20 minutes. Cheney spoke about the task force process, Kuhn said. He said Cheney's remarks were consistent with the vice president's public statements. Edison wants to see new generation and transmission systems built, including coal, natural gas and nuclear and hydroelectric power, Kuhn said. Democrats in Congress sought a list of participants in the meetings, but Cheney's office responded by only listing broad categories and no names. That has left fodder for political attack. "You can't just take advice from one interest group or set of interest groups when you do these things," said Dave Albersworth of the Wilderness Society, whose group has met with Lundquist but was denied its request to talk with Cheney. Weiss countered that the energy task force has collected information from more than 130 groups since January in an "almost Herculean effort" to draw input from all sides. "People deserve the right to petition their government and not expect a full laundry list of who's called to be announced," she said. Enron spokesman Palmer said he is not seeking such privacy. "I'm happy to tell people what we're advocating for. I'd rather be talking about policy than about politics," he said. --- On the Net: White House Energy Task Force: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud10.htmlCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

COMPANIES & FINANCE UK: Independents drill deep to strike rich seams: A new generation of smaller oil companies is emerging; a group that has discovered how to be competitive, writes David Buchan: Financial Times; May 14, 2001By DAVID BUCHANThe UK's listed small oil companies may have dwindled in number. But they can rightly say, echoing Mark Twain's words, that reports of their collective demise are exaggerated. Indeed, many in the UK-based exploration and production companies, dubbed "independents" in the sense of being untied to any refining and marketing, believe they have more of a role than when their kind first started operating in the North Sea 30 years ago. After the takeovers in recent years of Lasmo, Monument and British Borneo, there may only be about a dozen significant UK-based "independents" left. Yet they amount to virtually the entire European E&P sector: the only significant exception being Lundin Oil of Sweden. Many of the UK independents began life as local partners of US companies in the 1970s when the Labour government of the period gave preference to consortia with a local flavour. But this rationale disappeared when the Thatcher government took a more free-for-all approach to letting anyone develop the North Sea - though at the same time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British Gas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil. Enterprise is the only UK independent that is more than a niche or regional player. As such its E&P assets would be a significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured interest in taking it over. As the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-based independents began to look elsewhere. "Unlike US independents which have always tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America, those in the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the world", says Mark Redway of Teather and Greenwood. Unfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in the early 1990s was the former Soviet Union. One company, Ramco Energy, dipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake in the Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m). Other UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into Russia and got stuck. While Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because it has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam operations. Another UK independent, JKX Oil & Gas, went into Ukraine, a country notorious for non-payment of energy bills. With diplomatic help from Tony Blair, the prime minister, JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob it of its Ukraine assets. Two other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia. "Cairn Energy now has as big a stake in Bangladesh's gas production as Shell, and it would be left, if Enron (the US energy company) were to quit India, as the biggest foreign player in India," says Iain Reid of UBS Warburg. Premier Oil is now a substantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and Pakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore. But there are risks in these Asian ties. The obvious political one concerns Burma. Last year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its presence was helping the military regime. Premier refused, and said it would carry on. The other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to Cairn. Because there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are "very dependent on the strength of the local economies". But then, Mr Redway is an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in exploration rather than production. He therefore rates Fusion Oil & Gas highly as "the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&P sector". Dana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end. Its goal, according to Tom Cross, chief executive, is to find oil and then swap exploration for production assets. "This avoids the expensive development stage of building platforms and pipelines and so on". Then at the other end of the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oil or Venture Production. Roy Franklin, Paladin's chief executive, makes no bones about his company's scavenger strategy, spotting rich pickings overlooked by the majors. The majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oil price rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and sellers. But Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and is this year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is selling off. As its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company with North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not exploration. And so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort Energy and Highland Energy, formed in the past three or four years. This new generation of company tends to be more cautious than the older one. "Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value," says one executive. The other risk the new oilmen want to avoid is the vagaries of the stock market. "By focusing on production, the new companies are more predictable in terms of cash flow and earnings," says Mike Wagstaff, Venture's finance director.

QATAR: UAE's Dolphin may seek new partners if Enron exits.By Kedar Sharma05/14/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.DOHA, May 14 (Reuters) - Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL) may invite new foreign investors to join its project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates as U.S. Enron Corp looks set to bow out, industry sources said on Monday. "New partners are a possibility," Khaldoun al-Mubarak, project manager for DEL, majority owned by the UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), told Reuters."But at the moment we are in the midst of finalising the formal (development and production sharing) agreement with Qatar which should be done by September at the latest." Qatar and DEL in March signed a "commercial term sheet agreement" which outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited $3.5 billion project. UOG currently owns 51 percent of DEL, with the remainder held equally by France's TotalFinaElf and Enron. "Enron is going through major global restructuring," Mubarak said. "(But) they haven't officially notified us about their intention to pull out." Enron officials declined comment. Mubarak said interest in DEL was running high. "Everyone is asking for a stake," he said. The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet per day (cfd) of gas. UOG is to invest $2 billion in developing the North Field tract, drilling and setting up production facilities. The remaining $1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Ali and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi. First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or early 2005. About one billion to 1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would be consumed by utilities in Abu Dhabi with the remainder supplied to Dubai.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. UAE: UPDATE 1-Saudi expected to name gas race winners on Tuesday.By Peg Mackey05/14/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.DUBAI, May 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is expected to meet on Tuesday and announce the oil majors chosen for its multi-billion dollar gas investment opening, industry sources familiar with the negotiations said on Monday. The sources said the SPC is expected to name ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell as lead players in three so-called core projects involving the kingdom's upstream gas sector - off-limits to foreign oil firms since nationalisation in 1975.Signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) would most probably take place in early June, the sources said. The anticipated announcement would mark the biggest advance in the kingdom's gas initiative, valued at an initial $25 billion, since Riyadh unveiled its energy investment opening over two years ago. But the hard work has yet to start on the opening of Saudi Arabia's gas sector, the world's fourth biggest. "The fiscal regime and regulatory details have not been developed," said one source. FINAL CUT Riyadh is expected to trim back its original shortlist of 11 potential foreign investors revealed last summer. Those companies had been grouped under three core venture consortia - South Ghawar, Red Sea and Shaybah. For ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, securing the lead role in Saudi Arabia's core ventures would entitle them to operate the package and get the biggest slice of the projects, analysts said. Other industry sources said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company, was tipped for the top slot in core venture 1 (South Ghawar) as well as in core venture 2 (Red Sea). Royal Dutch/Shell was in pole position for core venture 3 (Shaybah), the sources added. Both oil supermajors already have significant foreign investment in the kingdom and feature as top customers of Saudi oil, the analysts said. ENERGY DRIVERS An urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy are driving Saudi Arabia's landmark energy opening. And analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve those aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low. "Major oil companies just cannot miss this opportunity," a source said. "The gas projects will show profits." But just how much revenue oil companies will generate by selling water and electricity in the Saudi domestic market remains to be seen. On paper, at least, the kingdom's domestic gas sector looks set for impressive growth. Domestic gas demand, now running at about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day, is forecast to grow at more than seven percent a year over the coming decade. Saudi Arabia has meanwhile made clear that its prized oil sector, the world's biggest, remains off limits. Even so, oil companies still hold out hope for eventual involvement in oil, the kingdom's lifeblood. "The companies are just as happy with gas, but oil remains the ultimate objective," a regional analyst said. "Saudi Aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers, but eventually they could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the majors." The Saudi gas initiative seeks foreign oil companies' help in developing the kingdom's known gas reserves as well as investment in downstream projects fed by gas supplies, such as power and desalination. The following companies have been shortlisted for the gas projects: Core venture 1 (South Ghawar Area) - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP , TotalFinaElf , Chevron and ENI . Core venture 2 (Red Sea Area) - TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Enron/Oxy , Conoco , Royal Dutch/Shell. Core venture 3 (Shaybah Area) - Royal Dutch/Shell, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Conoco, TotalFinaElf, Phillips and Enron/Oxy.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Saudi Oil Council To Meet Tue On Gas Projects -Sources05/14/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- International oil companies vying for a stake in Saudi Arabia's downstream gas projects, expect to be notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate, industry sources in the kingdom said Monday. Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council is set to meet Tuesday and shortly after, announce its final selection for each of the three core ventures on offer, the sources said.The Saudi Arabian committee negotiating with international oil companies on the Gas Initiative, submitted its proposals for consortium members and leaders to the country's Ministerial Council in April. These were then passed on to the SPC for final approval. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who heads the SPC, is in Bahrain Monday attending a Gulf Cooperation Council leaders' summit along with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Saud Al Faisal, who heads the gas negotiating committee. Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas enhancement. After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and IOC's in the past year, the following companies were shortlisted for each project. Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development. For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were listed. And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were listed. With all those shortlisted expected to play some role, the immediate and essential question for each of the IOC's is whether they will be selected to lead and operate a project, with Core Venture 1 the most sought after, industry sources said. Exxon Mobil and Shell have been tipped as frontrunners for this venture. The operator's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be responsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which will lead to final deals probably by year end. Also, operators are expected to decide and direct how the project's individual and large components will be developed, details the Saudis haven't finalized, sources said. The three ventures have been estimated at a combined value of about $25 billion. -By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714-331-4260; dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BusinessRFID chip will help speed up business05/14/2001The New Straits TimesMain/Lifestyle; 2*26(Copyright 2001)THE combination of recently developed "stick-on" Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip technology with a global positioning system (GSP) will transform and quicken the pace of doing business in the oil and gas industry. And Malaysia must adapt to this shift to maintain her global positioning.Global management and technology consultant Global Energy Strategy Practice which is working in partnership with Accenture Sdn Bhd wants to promote this idea locally. Global Energy Strategy Practice partner Paul Spence said that applying this latest combined technology, car owners can fill up a petrol tank without resorting to human contact or to the use of a credit card. Relevant personal data embedded in the RFID chip would be machine read and the required quantity of petrol delivered, as if right out of a science fiction movie. This surreal development is made possible through the application of ubiquitous-commerce (u-commerce) whereby computers and machines communicate with each other to affect an impression of an omnipresent intelligence. Such technology is economically available today. "There are technology suppliers who are offering these capabilities." The technology also has applications outside the oil and gas industry. Communications between machines can now allow or deny access of individuals to restricted zones. In an interview in Petaling Jaya recently, Spence said: "A lot of my clients now are asking, whether that same technology can be used to restrict access into hazardous areas, plants or production sites. "Can a warning alarm be fitted to the individual or to an assistant? There are lots of safety, health and environment applications around that." "Guru in the field" is another potential application where a combination of RFID chips, video cameras, personal digital assistants (PDA) and personal computers can deliver distant technical advice on- site. "An industry client operating in the North Sea oil fields has a prototype mounted on a workman's helmet which sends snap-shots to experts on the other side of the world. "The effect of this new combined technology on global financial and commodity markets is to lock them in tighter correlation. "The days of being able to arbitrage for profits between geographical markets are shortening within the energy industry. Enron which is the biggest oil trader in the US is now hedging on weather derivatives." Accenture partner Lim Beng Choon said that to compete globally, the oil and gas industry in Malaysia would have to implement this new technology to remain connected to global markets.Caption: Lim ... connected.

India: Godbole panel report may suggest MSEB bifurcation05/14/2001Business Line (The Hindu)Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence WireMUMBAI, May 13. THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is expected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15. While the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power purchase agreement with Enron's Dabhol Power Company, the second part is expected to suggest bifurcation of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, sources said. The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate with Enron officials to make DPC power more acceptable, had a marathon meeting on May 11 to finalise the second half of the report."The committee has been considering the bifurcation of MSEB," a source said. "The idea is to try and separate the distribution from generation and transmission." While generation and transmission can be controlled by the State, there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm. Over 1.5 lakh MSEB employees had gone on a strike to oppose a Bill to unbundle the board into three divisions - generation, transmission and distribution - due to fear of privatisation. MSEB, the State's leading power company, has been facing huge losses due to delay in payments and theft of power. The second part of the report is expected to address the problem in detail. Part one of the report submitted on April 10 had said: "...none of the solutions espoused for independent power producers, in general, and DPC, in particular, is tenable without the reforms of MSEB, especially its distribution business, which it shall address in part II of the report." The report is expected to "suggest appropriate measures to ensure that the interests of the State, MSEB and electricity consumers of the State of Maharashtra are properly and adequately considered, evaluated and safeguarded," according to the terms of reference laid down when forming the committee. The committee originally consisted of Dr Madhav Godbole, Mr Deepak Parekh, Dr E.A.S. Sarma, Dr Rajendra Pachauri and the State Energy Secretary, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal. The MSEB Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, has been inducted as part of the panel after the submission of the first part and before the beginning of negotiations with Enron.

The Smart InvestorTertiary will be primaryIndira Vergis05/14/2001Business Standard2Copyright (c) Business StandardThese are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies. Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a bout of slightly lower growth. But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank.Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up the GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard. However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from a lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon. An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And, they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move. Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian currency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector, stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon. Rain, rain, come again For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year. "According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year," says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J M Morgan Stanley Securities. In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a subsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by economists. "The performance of the agricultural sector is important because of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption side," says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research Ltd (CARE). "It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries," he adds. More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on agriculture for their livelihood. "A good crop means that demand for everything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like tractors will pick up," says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent. In service of the economy Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services. India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge slightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that overall GDP holds at six per cent. "Even if the agriculture and industry numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent," says Nagarajan. Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7 per cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped to show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies. Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more people to buy houses. Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services, says Morgan Stanley's Ahya. "We are emerging as the services workshop of the world," he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing, though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money spinners in the years ahead. The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment. "The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth rate," says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100 Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone. A good home show And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the gloom over its performance. Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest rates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year. While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven per cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale price index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on rural demand. Neighbours' envy And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to remain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are less dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand. With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is clearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the Philippines. Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 20 per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of good exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same period to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per cent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from $12.79 billion the previous year. Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American slump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a quarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 70 per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important software exports destination. Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic turbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit. It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion. Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from $6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression. "They are still talking about growth. It is a decline in the growth rate and not an actual downturn itself," points out John Band, chief executive officer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to maintain their pace as well. "Most remittances are still from Indians who live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment," says CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months to December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same period. Foreign institutions support Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too. Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the whole of calendar 2000. Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months, investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and seeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios, some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say. Because it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see India as some kind of a safe haven," says ASK's Band. Yet some hesitation Recently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government opened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including pharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence. However, tempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India. In 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the previous year to $2.4 billion. Yet, China a market India is frequently compared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in the same period. Economists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start investment in the country. "It's a pittance and it probably will remain stagnant," says an economist at a foreign research house. The reasons are not hard to find. Foreigners seeking to invest in India have many fences to cross. Frequent changes in sector policies, chaotic infrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often left foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India. The stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring concerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power project in Dabhol in Maharashtra. After being forced to renegotiate a power supply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines once again. This time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay its dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its commitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.It's led to intense speculation that, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply pull out of the project altogether. A disturbing turn of events, since, till recently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India. It will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign investor to pull out of a project. Earlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had also walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing endless bureaucratic hurdles. And there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300 million middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly. Many international firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up operations to conquer a huge chunk of this market. Now many are struggling to break even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for success. That's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors, India still remains a tough sell. Outlook With a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six per cent. Many economists have also pointed out that a reforms-studded budget could also inject some enthusiasm in the patient that is the economy. Strong measures include plans to reform labour laws and government employment. These are expected to boost the economy's development, though in the long run. The recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment, although whether this will translate into FDI flows is arguable. Still, every bit helps. The fact remains that it will have to persist in trying to accelerate the pace of growth if its ambitions of turning into an economic powerhouse are to be realised. After all, for the second most populous nation in the world with one of the biggest markets, its economic power is still nowhere near the figure its size suggests.Acegas shares, potential for growth (Acegas, le potenzialita di crescita del titolo)05/14/2001La Repubblica41Copyright (C) 2001 Abstracted from La Repubblica in Italian; Source: World Reporter (TM)Italian brokers Rasfin SIM have indicated the potential for growth in the shares of Acegas, the former municipal utility of the Italian city of Trieste. Acegas closed the first quarter of this year with turnover of L137bn (+45 per cent). Results attributed in part to the start of production of Estenergy, a consortium of the utilities of Udine, Trieste, Gorizia and Enron of the US, which supplies energy and services to parts of Friuli. Also significant, according to Rasfin, were investments over the period, which totalled L43bn.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. A SectionIN THE LOOP Al KamenRoundabout to the Oval OfficeAl Kamen05/14/2001The Washington PostFINALA19Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights ReservedSometimes even Cabinet officers can lose their way in the White House. So there was Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, clearly lost Friday at a fork in a corridor near White House spokesman Ari Fleischer's office. "How do you get to the Oval Office?" he asked a group of reporters and was directed to the right door, according to a wire report.Fleischer, though, told reporters that was the wrong answer. "How do you get to the Oval Office? First you win the Iowa caucus, then you lose the New Hampshire primary, then you make a comeback in South Carolina," he quipped as he recalled President Bush's early primary campaign last year. Passport, Please Meanwhile, folks at Thompson's HHS may be taking to calling him "Tightwad Tommy." Seems a memo went out March 15 undermining Alaska and Hawaii's claims to be part of the United States. Employees "must clear . . . international travel" with the office of the deputy chief of staff for operations, said the memo from the deputy chief, Ed Sontag. To clarify, "HHS employees seeking to travel outside the continental U.S." for meetings and conferences, must get permission and then file trip reports within two weeks. This sent officials calling around, asking whether trips to those states were to go through the international travel approval system just as if they were going to Russia or the Congo. Apparently so. The edict would appear to include even the nearby Virgin Islands and practically next-door Puerto Rico as well. Loop Fans can only hope this outrage doesn't spread to other agencies. It would make for some cold winters. Chewing Out on the Bush Beat Speaking of Fleischer, the usually affable spokesman is not reluctant to get tough with reporters when he believes they've stepped out of line. Sheriff Fleischer was on duty Thursday and upset with Houston Chronicle reporter Bennett Roth. Bush that morning urged parents to talk more to their kids about the dangers of drugs. Roth, at Fleischer's daily briefing, asked: "Ari, the president talked about parental involvement today. How much has he talked to his own daughters about both drugs and drinking? And given the fact that his own daughter was cited for underage drinking, isn't that a sign that there's only so much effect that a parent can have on their children's behavior?" Fleischer responded brusquely: "No, I think, frankly, there are some issues where I think it's very important for you all in the press corps to recognize that he is the president of the United States; he's also a father. And the press corps has been very respectful in the past of treating family matters with privacy, and I'm certain that you're going to do so again. I hope so." Fleischer later called Roth to chastise him, telling him his question had been "noted in the building." Competing to Oversee the Corps Former Mississippi representative Mike Parker, a Democrat-turned-Republican who lost a gubernatorial bid a couple of years back, had been seen as the pick to be assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, overseeing the Army Corps of Engineers. Parker, a former undertaker, had support from the barge industry, the various corps constituencies and fellow Mississippian Trent Lott, the majority leader of the Senate. But the Pentagon's choice was Lawrence Izzo, recently retired president of Enron Engineering and Construction Co. who has been in the mix for several jobs. Izzo, a West Point grad, had 23 years at the Corps before going to Enron, former home of Army secretary-designate Thomas White. The majority leader was said to be most unhappy. The latest word is Parker's getting the job. Ex-Reporters Move On Kenneth J. Klein, a former reporter who has worked for 17 years for Florida Sen. Bob Graham (D), most recently as chief of staff, is joining the Outdoor Advertising Association of America as executive vice president for government relations.

Largest LNG 13 Conference Opens Today05/14/2001Korea TimesCopyright (C) 2001 Korea Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)The largest-ever International Conference and Exhibition on liquefied natural gas (LNG 13) opens today for a four-day run at the Convention and Exhibition Center (COEX) in southern Seoul. A total of 125 companies and organizations represented by 2,500 delegates and exhibitors from 50-odd countries, including Japan, the United States, Britain and Australia, are participating in the international event, co- organized by the Korea Gas Union and the Korea Gas Corp. (KOGAS).Commerce, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Che-shik will be delivering congratulatory remarks on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Han-dong who is currently on an official trip to the Middle East. There will be a visual presentation from Lee during the opening ceremony. ``We have spent more than a year preparing for this international event which is the largest in terms of the number of participants and exhibitors,'' said Lee Seung-hwan, chairman of the Korean National Organizing Committee. LNG 13 is 15 percent larger than the conference and exhibition held in Australia back in 1998 which reflects the growth of the industry, Lee explained, adding that the demand for LNG has been increasing rapidly here in Korea. A wide range of topics will be presented during the four days of conferences and exhibitions, helping to showcase the importance of the LNG industry. Among the numerous papers to be presented at the triennial event are ``Old World, New World, Tomorrow's World: How LNG Has Changed Since LNG 12'' and ``The Next Generation of LNG Plants.'' ``Hosting this meaningful event in Korea will help elevate Korea's image in the international market, particularly with the sheer scale and size of LNG 13,'' said Kim Myung-kyu, president and CEO of KOGAS and chairman of the Korea gas Union. The conference will include paper sessions, workshops, poster sessions and film presentations while exhibitors will demonstrate their exclusive technologies for the exploration and production of LNG as well as plant construction. The official sponsors of LNG 13 are the International Gas Union, the Gas Technology Institute and the International institute of Refrigeration while the major sponsors are Shell Gas and Power, KOGAS, LG-Caltex, SK-Enron, the Qatari Group, TotalFinaElf, British Petroleum and Exxon Mobile. In addition to the conference and exhibition, there will be a technical visit to the Inchon LNG Receiving Terminal in Inchon, about 50 kilometers west of Seoul, on Friday.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they will not be able to block the move.Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. "In the first round, Indian lenders put their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice," said a source. The Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement said. SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for construction. Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 6,000 megawatts, are under construction. Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei05/15/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. (ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant benefits to end-users. New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia." In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a company official. Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business interest. Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power generation facilities, Enron says. Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(NGX), a wholly owned subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas Price Indices. NGX acquired the AECO "C" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, "We believe that inclusion of data from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that "more is better". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline system should improve the quality of our price indices even further." Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, "We are very pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices." The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be on a weighted-average basis. NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com.

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj05/15/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while UOG owns the remaining 51%. Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put up the money itself. Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf willoperate the upstream part of the project, which includes developingnatural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 2005. Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on the price of the pipeline. Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said. -By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714 331 4260; dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)2001-05-15 16:35 (New York)Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)     (Updates with closing share prices.)     Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sellPortland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can beinsulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.     ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control bykeeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,''U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield,Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.     The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, saidKitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.     Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader,agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, autility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra PacificResources of Reno, Nevada.     Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high powerprices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale'scollapse.     ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our assetportfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enronspokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer whorecognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined tocomment on a potential bid by Oregon.     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing pressreports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for PortlandGeneral.     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have morethan 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it addedPortland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns aboutmarket power,'' he said.                            Bond Issue     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, usingthe utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The statemight run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General salebecause of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators thatslow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants byutilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada powerplant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval ofthe Portland General purchase.     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border thisyear have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average Californiahomes for an hour.     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31percent this year.     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9pence to 492 ($7) in London.Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)     (Adds closing share price.)     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world'sbiggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricinginformation to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, aunit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't includetrades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculatinggas-price indexes.     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades incalculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enronspokesman Eric Thode said.     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnlineto sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of thecleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.     Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99.

And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus this year, a flashlight. As state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during California's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the 31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts may disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday.''People here are used to interruptions,'' Sara Abbas, 21, a senior communications major, said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus. ''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot. People have cut the power lines. They just reschedule.'' In an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R. Gray, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the disposition of their examinations once the exam has started.'' Among the options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether. Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms have windows. ''In some classrooms,'' Mr. Gray noted, ''students may have sufficient natural light.'' The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of California and California State University. The two systems are embroiled in a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to the universities. For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. Though several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert. At Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress levels. ''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because I save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a sophomore majoring in political science. Aaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively, planning to return later with more care. ''The only thing I don't have a problem with is if the professors give everyone A's,'' Mr. Chung, 23, said. ''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.'' Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on the grass. But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the final counts for only 20 percent of the grade. That is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class, is hoping for. ''I would love a blackout,'' Ms. Chen said. ''I'm going to turn on my air-conditioner. My toaster, too.''Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BusinessBritish TelecomPatience Wheatcroft05/12/2001The Times of LondonNews InternationalFinal 455(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year. But others are still lining up to put the boot in. Hours after the company announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating. This thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans as well as making future working capital more expensive. The timing is odd. One of the two other main agencies presented with the same BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that change-of-rating clauses were not triggered. In the meantime, the market prices of BT debt have been rising. The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February. Such costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies, whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.Moody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the whims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities. Moody's will no doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a result. In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms. The Office of Fair Trading has reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up. The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking. But it appears to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too much, so prices should fall further. The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum. This sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation. It must strengthen the resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the greater advantage of shareholders.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. OUTLOOKOutlookHouston needs to think small about future technologyWILLIAM DYLAN POWELL05/13/2001Houston Chronicle2 STAR4(Copyright 2001)OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook readers. Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone mentions Houston? Time's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random acts of highway closure. But how about something very, very small? While Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature. As technology advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular scale (the prefix "nano" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power numerically). Its theories and practices give scientists the means to construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered matter. Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback, you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises. The possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories that could fit neatly on your desk. Cancer-destroying robots could roam a patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration. Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated. And all manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the environment and from a business process standpoint. Sound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with fiction. A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a functional switch out of a single organic molecule. Discoveries such as these have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS (nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine. This technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affect Houston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's economic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds. And the energy industry, still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities of nanotech. This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic development. Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two separate fronts. First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain; and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering, nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies). But too much technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities. Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister to the north. The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye on developments in small science. In March, a private-sector company donated $2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research. And a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of their own. This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology. Houston has its own projects, but they receive far less publicity. Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice University's grand Turks of academia. Pushing the envelope of academic excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting technology. But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity and support than other less commercially significant disciplines. On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends that will affect Houston's future. Will the keynote speakers (chief executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its potential economic impact on the region? I certainly hope so. Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of Houston's economy. Each of these industry sectors could reap profound benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light. Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off. But it's going to become remarkably important sooner than we think. So while Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think small. Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to our city and its economic development.Drawing Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. APanel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of life top group's list of needed improvementsMIKE SNYDERStaff05/13/2001Houston Chronicle4 STAR33(Copyright 2001)A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base. The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever they choose.Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn enrich the lives of every Houstonian. "The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests of the community at large," said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future. A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have discouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20 years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of successors. The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role in Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined. "Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of Houston," the report states. "But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter how benevolent those leaders might be." The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer, president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership. Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf. "They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool around with something that is ill-conceived," he said. Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's work could be very influential. "This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the part of the business community" to improve Houston's quality of life, Klineberg said. The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier business organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future. Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people representing a cross section of the business community. These 10-day, seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston scenarios. James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative" and are not necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However, they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said. In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power. Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax rate increase. Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year hardship post on the way to something more desirable." Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in turn leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007. These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or technical training programs. The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they would be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent on more traditional educational programs. In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically competitive. These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and public transport in corridors that delight the eye." Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate pedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail lines extending in various directions. To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt "new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city centers. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city." Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy." The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns its energy toward diversifying the economy. The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly become significant global players. The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city in which to live and conduct business." Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such as education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to begin translating these ideas into policy, they said. Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce results as soon as possible. "If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute. "We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure that we educate these kids for our future."Mugs: 1. Ken Lay (p. 45); 2. Ned Holmes (p. 45); 3. James Royer (p. 45); 4.

MSEB not to pick up 15 pc in DPC after phase II completion05/13/2001Press Trust of India Limited(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol. "It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the phase II of the project", a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday.Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB -15 per cent, General Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each. However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard, the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the completion of the project. DPC's USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus marking completion of the 2,184 MW project. DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEB's equity. The company had decided to off load the 15 per cent of its current holding of 65 per cent to a new entity, as according to the company's global debt-consolidation it needed to maintain its stake at 50 per cent in DPC after its completion. In order to avoid any delay, Enron had agreed to meet up with the equity shortfall as per the former's agreement with its lenders.

Enron plans to pull out of Gulf gas project: MEED05/13/2001Agence France-Presse(Copyright 2001)DUBAI, May 13 (AFP) - Enron Corp. of the United States plans to pull out of a project to deliver Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) reported on Sunday. Enron is a partner in the Dolphin Energy project along with the Franco-Belgian company TotalFinaElf and the Abu Dhabi government- owned UAE Offsets Group (UOG). Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi."The profit margin for Enron would be low. At present, the Dolphin project is being developed primarily as an upstream venture," an industry source told MEED. Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as too high. "There is talk of new partners," a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED. "But whatever happens, we are staying." On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic metres) of natural gas per day. Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999. According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following "high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi". TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake. From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to Dubai and Oman. An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also planned, as part of a regional gas network. hc/rpCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESSSMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what amounts to limo service on the lakeCAROL RUSTSpecial to the Chronicle05/13/2001Houston Chronicle2 STAR1(Copyright 2001)KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden box he'd made at school. "This is my houseboat," he told his mother 35 years ago. "When I grow up, I'm going to live on a boat."His practical-minded mother put the "boat" to work as a patio plant stand until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure. On a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay. "This is what I love," Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant boats. "The others are here to party, but this is it for me." The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party for a major customer. A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her neck. In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year. Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme. One guy recently plunked down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date. One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings. Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as regular on-board equipment. "It's a bizarre business," Lober said. "Nothing seems unusual anymore." Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina, transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The galley crew does the final cooking. Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but Lober has hundreds of competitors locally. "I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating, drinking and party business," he said. "People say there are two things you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on a boat." Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a 30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a limo does on land. Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiters deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake. Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in Trinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981. But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat to providing exclusive entertainment on the water. In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism or other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners, researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take to float his idea. Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150 passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay. "I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five feet deep in places, he said. Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan. "This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober said. "They had no confidence. "I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and tell me what it needs,' " he said. Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week, he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up. After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60 percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar engines on the boat. Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair. Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993. The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but it didn't prepare him for marketing. "I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent $125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that he called "a total flop." Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell, he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a time. Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental, insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave once," he said. Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he got one: target marketing. He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy Mills mall. "We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif. "The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before. Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back." Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth, the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future. "We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the other boats," he said. After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting everything back into the business. The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate. But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers. "We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said. It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other locations on the Houston Ship Channel. If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor causes the player to bounce. Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's stanchions into palm trees. And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being honored at a recent floating awards banquet. Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back. "They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something different. We provide a different kind of party. If they do it once, they usually want to do it again." But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes. About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company has chosen to have with Star Fleet. Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are. "It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston. Even in Clear Lake, there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can actually see the water. We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor. So people have to be reminded." He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford cruises, Lober said. "Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities, country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said. "And our food is gourmet quality. Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut corners." Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax and gratuities. Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks. "We learn a lot from our customers," he said. "We see what they do, take the best and give it back to them." Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers moving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375 guests. But one boat can still do a lot of advertising. At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him. As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge under construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes - the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment. It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from school years ago, Lober says. And he's going to live at the top.Photos: 1-2.

More power to reform agendaSoma Banerjee05/13/2001The Economic TimesCopyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)THE electricity industry is often identified as the black sheep in the infrastructure sector which has continued to lag behind despite an overdose of government support. Despite being one of the earlier industries to be opened up, private investments in this sector have failed to take off.Worse, the only sizeable project which was something to write home about Enrons Dabhol Power plant in Maharashtra is currently a under cloud with its promoters involved in a legal battle with the state entity and its sole consumer for non-payment of bills. Policy makers and investors in the energy sector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of this key industry. Although private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating new capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health of the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power plant developers. After about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit only about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in greenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years. The factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection are almost inbuilt into the system. For one, there is a general agreement that stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution front has eroded the financial health of most SEBs. ``Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they are assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say. But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before they break even. The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron too says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry. IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it difficult for investors to take decisions. ``Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for eight projects, of which only three have taken off. Of this the Enron project is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source. According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs have registered a negative turnover. Which is why the financing or escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero. According to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results. But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that can help this backbencher.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit PossibleBy Himendra KumarOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES05/12/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu said. In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project.A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another meeting May 23. Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours. "I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes," Prabhu said. Earlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron Vice President John Ambler however, said, "While we have constantly maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract." The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9 billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs. A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel, recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated. Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer, failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each. -By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427; himendra.kumar@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. India: Talks begin on Dabhol issue05/12/2001Business Line (The Hindu)Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence WireMUMBAI, May 11. OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power Company. Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice.Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away. Instead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development Bank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting. When asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: "They are coming again on May 23. What does that mean?" Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details, senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the rebate slapped on DPC. "Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by DPC to the centre-stage," the official said. "The company has not mentioned a single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or the State. And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate in our letters to DPC," he said. Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the company would issue the preliminary termination notice. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their stand vis-a-vis Enron. They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project. They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is learnt. MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it against the non-performance penalty. Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice issued by DPC and made its position clear. The board is of the opinion that DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default. The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three arbitration notices served on it. It has said that since MSEB does not accept the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) - leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay. The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to the conciliation notice from DPC. Today's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC, Mr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and Mr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC. Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend. The next meeting is scheduled on May 23, Mr Lal said. Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr Harish Salve's candidature for the job. The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third conciliator is yet to be appointed. Dabhol Power Company had written to the Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process. DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators. Soon after the conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the project.

India to allow 3rd party sale if DPC, MSEB jointly approach05/12/2001Press Trust of India Limited(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) The Federal Government will allow sale of power to a "willing buyer" if the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will together approach the power ministry with a concrete proposal for their 2,184 mw project in Dabhol. "I will give whatever status they want, including a mega project one, if DPC and MSEB jointly approach the Centre (Federal Government) for the same", Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters here Saturday.He said the Indian Government would extend its cooperation to the Maharashtra government (western state) "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between MSEB and DPC. When pointed out that both the state government and DPC were of the opinion that federal power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should buy the power, Prabhu said NTPC cannot do so as it was power selling entity and not buying one. "There is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed by NTPC with the buying states", he reiterated. Prabhu said the Indian Government would also try and find out potential buyers of DPC power "if other states were willing to buy the same". Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 300-400 MW needed for the state from the 740 MW phase-I and soon to be commissioned phase-II of 1,444 MW, to other needy states.

Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else. Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon. "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore. PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month. Other possible buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp. While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea. "I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this time," said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. He said the state already has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and conservation. Senate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and talk with DeFazio. "I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't plan to devote much work to the proposal. Derfler questioned whether state government could run a utility as efficiently as a business. DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway corporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would provide some protection and stability in electricity rates. It also would be a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back into the state's coffers. The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state. DeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was "in the realm of possibility." DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE. Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to publicly owned utilities. However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity sales contracts that already are in place. And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks said. In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower. The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE, but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly owned utilities. He also said it seemed designed to get political attention for DeFazio's potential candidacy. "I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of those," Eachus said. DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with his plan.

BEGGSAssociated Press Writer05/11/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs. The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber, who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000 customers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets." DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and have the utility operate as a public power entity. He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources. "While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation. Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility. Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion, citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political environment in the West. Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private utility, as long as it would benefit consumers. DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville Power Administration's hydropower. The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature. "Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons. "Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said. "We have a bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue." Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating plants. Senate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job like a utility purchase.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

meeting with : After our meeting with Dell on 10/27, I sent a request to Charlie Ball (works for Kip) for detailed power data from TXU. Charlie delegated the task of getting this data to Randy Don Carlos, who has yet to return any of my calls to update the status of the request.Charlie Ball left me a message this morning indicating that Randy Don Carlos was leaving Dell at the end of the month. He indicated that he will get the information to me as soon as he can. I'm not sure, but it seems that no one has sent the request to TXU yet. TXU generally will send out data within 1-2 weeks of a request. It has now been 6 weeks since we asked Dell for the data. Assuming Charlie actually gets someone to send the data request to TXU, we should get something by the end of the year.Similarly, Continental has not yet sent over data that they were to request from HL&P. I talked with someone in Mark's group on 12/4, and she indicated that they had the data, but their real estate group wanted to review it before they sent it to us. On this one also, it is unlikely that any transaction will get done in this calendar year.Please call if you have any questions.

City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron Corp. The water corporation, known as "the Hawk," voted 5-0 to grant the contract. If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant expansion for $32 million. But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds itself. The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could cost about $2 billion to implement. City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee this contract. The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. "In my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who will do it," Robinson said. The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council members to switch the contract to it. Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the Hawk procedures as well. John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman David Berg complaining of the "deleterious economic effect" on Azurix of the board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the job. Berg didn't do so. Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project Financial Times; May 15, 2001By ROBIN ALLENThere are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of "selling" at least part of its shareholding. The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. The project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a large-scale project, especially in the early stages. Dolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific North Field to Abu Dhabi. Qatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. "If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable" for western energy majors, asked one senior western diplomat, "then why are the serious US energy majors not involved?" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy Copyright: The Financial Times LimitedJAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). "If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per year," Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high electricity rates. A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the international market. Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating its market in 1998. These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. "The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California," Kean said. North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process he said held many benefits. Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts said at an industry seminar Tuesday. The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in March 2000.However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies. "What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly," said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the University of Tokyo. Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users. "There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization," Hatta said. He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered once the prices are liberalized. "If power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using electricity." Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. (ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries following the liberalization. Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called "Reassessing Power Deregulation," which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. Hatta of the University of Tokyo said "it's very wise" that Japan has begun the deregulation with the "bilateral supply, or trade" system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly. Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers, Hatta said. Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates - regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs are levied on prices. "There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices" nationwide, Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with "strong back-up" from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. "Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select independent power providers," Omuro said. -By Maki Aoto, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; maki.aoto@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.By Cameron Dueck05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and bankers say. But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity across Asia, they say. It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security offered by government payment guarantees. "Independant power producers (IPPs) will see Enron and Dabhol as an illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging market, but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be adversely affected because of it," said Philip Jackson, a banker with JP Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills. MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron. The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the $48.2 million outstanding. The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to MSEB if the dispute is not resolved. Local media reports earlier in May said Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital expenditure. Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or even changes in market conditions. But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient enough to back these agreements. Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they said. "Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're even more so," said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in Singapore. "If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad." Robert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy away from emerging Asian nations. "Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to call in a government guarantee," Booth said.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Saudi Won't Announce Winners Of Gas Projs Tue - Report05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported. The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers."Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with recommendations from the technical committee," the sources said, according to the newspaper. However, the oil council "might endorse some balances concerning the offers," the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further. Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas projects. Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas enhancement. After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and the oil companies in the past year, several companies were shortlisted for each project. The companies shortlisted for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development were Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E). For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were shortlisted. And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were shortlisted. -By Abdulla Fardan, Dow Jones Newswires; 973-530758; abdullah.fardan@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

MSEB refutes allegations by Enron, DPCGirish Kuber05/15/2001The Economic TimesCopyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)MUMBAI THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board on Monday in a letter to Enron refuted all allegations made against it by the company while invoking the political force majeure.Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on April 9 had invoked the political force majeure clause. DPC had indicated it was not in a position to fulfil its contractual obligations to MSEB because of political circumstances beyond its control. MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political circumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure. "Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related security documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our rights'," DPC had said. However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was uncalled for. For DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events occurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. MSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday. The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, which had been subjected to "concerted, deliberate and politically motivated actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform obligations under PPA". "Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that the political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for providing that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in protecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights," the statement added. However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs 402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply electricity as per the agreement. MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on Enron for not supplying electricity as per demand. MSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs 213 crore.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Saudi Supreme Petrol Council meeting to decide on huge gas project bids05/15/2001Business RecorderCopyright (C) 2001 Business Recorder; Source: World Reporter (TM)RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday. "The SPC has been discussing recommendations by the negotiating committee about the bids, and the meetings will continues executive president of the committee Abdulrahman al-Suhaibani told AFP. "It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final decision will be issued," added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon. The meetings began two weeks ago.A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. "The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early next week," the executive told AFP. The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, Conocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been shortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the executive said. Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic metres).-AFPCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they will not be able to block the move.Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. "In the first round, Indian lenders put their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice," said a source. The Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement said. SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for construction. Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 6,000 megawatts, are under construction. Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei05/15/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. (ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant benefits to end-users. New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia." In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a company official. Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business interest. Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power generation facilities, Enron says. Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(NGX), a wholly owned subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas Price Indices. NGX acquired the AECO "C" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, "We believe that inclusion of data from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that "more is better". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline system should improve the quality of our price indices even further." Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, "We are very pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices." The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be on a weighted-average basis. NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com.

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj05/15/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while UOG owns the remaining 51%. Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put up the money itself. Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf willoperate the upstream part of the project, which includes developingnatural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 2005. Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on the price of the pipeline. Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said. -By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714 331 4260; dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)2001-05-15 16:35 (New York)Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)     (Updates with closing share prices.)     Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sellPortland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can beinsulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.     ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control bykeeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,''U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield,Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.     The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, saidKitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.     Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader,agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, autility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra PacificResources of Reno, Nevada.     Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high powerprices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale'scollapse.     ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our assetportfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enronspokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer whorecognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined tocomment on a potential bid by Oregon.     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing pressreports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for PortlandGeneral.     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have morethan 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it addedPortland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns aboutmarket power,'' he said.                            Bond Issue     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, usingthe utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The statemight run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General salebecause of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators thatslow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants byutilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada powerplant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval ofthe Portland General purchase.     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border thisyear have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average Californiahomes for an hour.     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31percent this year.     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9pence to 492 ($7) in London.Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)     (Adds closing share price.)     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world'sbiggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricinginformation to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, aunit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't includetrades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculatinggas-price indexes.     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades incalculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enronspokesman Eric Thode said.     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnlineto sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of thecleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.     Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99.

And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus this year, a flashlight. As state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during California's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the 31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts may disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday.''People here are used to interruptions,'' Sara Abbas, 21, a senior communications major, said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus. ''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot. People have cut the power lines. They just reschedule.'' In an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R. Gray, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the disposition of their examinations once the exam has started.'' Among the options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether. Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms have windows. ''In some classrooms,'' Mr. Gray noted, ''students may have sufficient natural light.'' The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of California and California State University. The two systems are embroiled in a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to the universities. For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. Though several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert. At Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress levels. ''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because I save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a sophomore majoring in political science. Aaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively, planning to return later with more care. ''The only thing I don't have a problem with is if the professors give everyone A's,'' Mr. Chung, 23, said. ''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.'' Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on the grass. But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the final counts for only 20 percent of the grade. That is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class, is hoping for. ''I would love a blackout,'' Ms. Chen said. ''I'm going to turn on my air-conditioner. My toaster, too.''Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BusinessBritish TelecomPatience Wheatcroft05/12/2001The Times of LondonNews InternationalFinal 455(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year. But others are still lining up to put the boot in. Hours after the company announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating. This thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans as well as making future working capital more expensive. The timing is odd. One of the two other main agencies presented with the same BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that change-of-rating clauses were not triggered. In the meantime, the market prices of BT debt have been rising. The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February. Such costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies, whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.Moody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the whims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities. Moody's will no doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a result. In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms. The Office of Fair Trading has reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up. The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking. But it appears to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too much, so prices should fall further. The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum. This sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation. It must strengthen the resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the greater advantage of shareholders.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. OUTLOOKOutlookHouston needs to think small about future technologyWILLIAM DYLAN POWELL05/13/2001Houston Chronicle2 STAR4(Copyright 2001)OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook readers. Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone mentions Houston? Time's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random acts of highway closure. But how about something very, very small? While Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature. As technology advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular scale (the prefix "nano" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power numerically). Its theories and practices give scientists the means to construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered matter. Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback, you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises. The possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories that could fit neatly on your desk. Cancer-destroying robots could roam a patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration. Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated. And all manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the environment and from a business process standpoint. Sound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with fiction. A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a functional switch out of a single organic molecule. Discoveries such as these have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS (nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine. This technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affect Houston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's economic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds. And the energy industry, still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities of nanotech. This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic development. Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two separate fronts. First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain; and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering, nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies). But too much technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities. Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister to the north. The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye on developments in small science. In March, a private-sector company donated $2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research. And a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of their own. This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology. Houston has its own projects, but they receive far less publicity. Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice University's grand Turks of academia. Pushing the envelope of academic excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting technology. But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity and support than other less commercially significant disciplines. On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends that will affect Houston's future. Will the keynote speakers (chief executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its potential economic impact on the region? I certainly hope so. Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of Houston's economy. Each of these industry sectors could reap profound benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light. Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off. But it's going to become remarkably important sooner than we think. So while Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think small. Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to our city and its economic development.Drawing Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. APanel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of life top group's list of needed improvementsMIKE SNYDERStaff05/13/2001Houston Chronicle4 STAR33(Copyright 2001)A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base. The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever they choose.Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn enrich the lives of every Houstonian. "The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests of the community at large," said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future. A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have discouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20 years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of successors. The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role in Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined. "Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of Houston," the report states. "But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter how benevolent those leaders might be." The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer, president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership. Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf. "They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool around with something that is ill-conceived," he said. Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's work could be very influential. "This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the part of the business community" to improve Houston's quality of life, Klineberg said. The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier business organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future. Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people representing a cross section of the business community. These 10-day, seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston scenarios. James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative" and are not necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However, they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said. In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power. Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax rate increase. Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year hardship post on the way to something more desirable." Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in turn leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007. These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or technical training programs. The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they would be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent on more traditional educational programs. In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically competitive. These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and public transport in corridors that delight the eye." Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate pedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail lines extending in various directions. To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt "new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city centers. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city." Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy." The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns its energy toward diversifying the economy. The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly become significant global players. The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city in which to live and conduct business." Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such as education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to begin translating these ideas into policy, they said. Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce results as soon as possible. "If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute. "We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure that we educate these kids for our future."Mugs: 1. Ken Lay (p. 45); 2. Ned Holmes (p. 45); 3. James Royer (p. 45); 4.

MSEB not to pick up 15 pc in DPC after phase II completion05/13/2001Press Trust of India Limited(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol. "It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the phase II of the project", a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday.Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB -15 per cent, General Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each. However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard, the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the completion of the project. DPC's USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus marking completion of the 2,184 MW project. DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEB's equity. The company had decided to off load the 15 per cent of its current holding of 65 per cent to a new entity, as according to the company's global debt-consolidation it needed to maintain its stake at 50 per cent in DPC after its completion. In order to avoid any delay, Enron had agreed to meet up with the equity shortfall as per the former's agreement with its lenders.

Enron plans to pull out of Gulf gas project: MEED05/13/2001Agence France-Presse(Copyright 2001)DUBAI, May 13 (AFP) - Enron Corp. of the United States plans to pull out of a project to deliver Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) reported on Sunday. Enron is a partner in the Dolphin Energy project along with the Franco-Belgian company TotalFinaElf and the Abu Dhabi government- owned UAE Offsets Group (UOG). Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi."The profit margin for Enron would be low. At present, the Dolphin project is being developed primarily as an upstream venture," an industry source told MEED. Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as too high. "There is talk of new partners," a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED. "But whatever happens, we are staying." On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic metres) of natural gas per day. Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999. According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following "high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi". TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake. From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to Dubai and Oman. An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also planned, as part of a regional gas network. hc/rpCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESSSMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what amounts to limo service on the lakeCAROL RUSTSpecial to the Chronicle05/13/2001Houston Chronicle2 STAR1(Copyright 2001)KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden box he'd made at school. "This is my houseboat," he told his mother 35 years ago. "When I grow up, I'm going to live on a boat."His practical-minded mother put the "boat" to work as a patio plant stand until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure. On a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay. "This is what I love," Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant boats. "The others are here to party, but this is it for me." The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party for a major customer. A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her neck. In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year. Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme. One guy recently plunked down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date. One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings. Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as regular on-board equipment. "It's a bizarre business," Lober said. "Nothing seems unusual anymore." Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina, transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The galley crew does the final cooking. Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but Lober has hundreds of competitors locally. "I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating, drinking and party business," he said. "People say there are two things you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on a boat." Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a 30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a limo does on land. Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiters deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake. Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in Trinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981. But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat to providing exclusive entertainment on the water. In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism or other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners, researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take to float his idea. Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150 passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay. "I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five feet deep in places, he said. Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan. "This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober said. "They had no confidence. "I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and tell me what it needs,' " he said. Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week, he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up. After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60 percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar engines on the boat. Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair. Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993. The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but it didn't prepare him for marketing. "I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent $125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that he called "a total flop." Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell, he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a time. Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental, insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave once," he said. Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he got one: target marketing. He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy Mills mall. "We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif. "The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before. Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back." Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth, the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future. "We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the other boats," he said. After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting everything back into the business. The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate. But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers. "We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said. It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other locations on the Houston Ship Channel. If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor causes the player to bounce. Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's stanchions into palm trees. And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being honored at a recent floating awards banquet. Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back. "They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something different. We provide a different kind of party. If they do it once, they usually want to do it again." But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes. About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company has chosen to have with Star Fleet. Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are. "It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston. Even in Clear Lake, there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can actually see the water. We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor. So people have to be reminded." He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford cruises, Lober said. "Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities, country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said. "And our food is gourmet quality. Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut corners." Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax and gratuities. Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks. "We learn a lot from our customers," he said. "We see what they do, take the best and give it back to them." Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers moving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375 guests. But one boat can still do a lot of advertising. At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him. As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge under construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes - the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment. It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from school years ago, Lober says. And he's going to live at the top.Photos: 1-2.

More power to reform agendaSoma Banerjee05/13/2001The Economic TimesCopyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)THE electricity industry is often identified as the black sheep in the infrastructure sector which has continued to lag behind despite an overdose of government support. Despite being one of the earlier industries to be opened up, private investments in this sector have failed to take off.Worse, the only sizeable project which was something to write home about Enrons Dabhol Power plant in Maharashtra is currently a under cloud with its promoters involved in a legal battle with the state entity and its sole consumer for non-payment of bills. Policy makers and investors in the energy sector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of this key industry. Although private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating new capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health of the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power plant developers. After about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit only about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in greenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years. The factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection are almost inbuilt into the system. For one, there is a general agreement that stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution front has eroded the financial health of most SEBs. ``Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they are assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say. But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before they break even. The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron too says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry. IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it difficult for investors to take decisions. ``Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for eight projects, of which only three have taken off. Of this the Enron project is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source. According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs have registered a negative turnover. Which is why the financing or escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero. According to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results. But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that can help this backbencher.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit PossibleBy Himendra KumarOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES05/12/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu said. In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project.A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another meeting May 23. Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours. "I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes," Prabhu said. Earlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron Vice President John Ambler however, said, "While we have constantly maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract." The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9 billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs. A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel, recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated. Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer, failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each. -By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427; himendra.kumar@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. India: Talks begin on Dabhol issue05/12/2001Business Line (The Hindu)Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence WireMUMBAI, May 11. OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power Company. Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice.Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away. Instead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development Bank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting. When asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: "They are coming again on May 23. What does that mean?" Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details, senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the rebate slapped on DPC. "Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by DPC to the centre-stage," the official said. "The company has not mentioned a single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or the State. And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate in our letters to DPC," he said. Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the company would issue the preliminary termination notice. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their stand vis-a-vis Enron. They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project. They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is learnt. MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it against the non-performance penalty. Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice issued by DPC and made its position clear. The board is of the opinion that DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default. The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three arbitration notices served on it. It has said that since MSEB does not accept the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) - leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay. The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to the conciliation notice from DPC. Today's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC, Mr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and Mr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC. Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend. The next meeting is scheduled on May 23, Mr Lal said. Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr Harish Salve's candidature for the job. The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third conciliator is yet to be appointed. Dabhol Power Company had written to the Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process. DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators. Soon after the conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the project.

India to allow 3rd party sale if DPC, MSEB jointly approach05/12/2001Press Trust of India Limited(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) The Federal Government will allow sale of power to a "willing buyer" if the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will together approach the power ministry with a concrete proposal for their 2,184 mw project in Dabhol. "I will give whatever status they want, including a mega project one, if DPC and MSEB jointly approach the Centre (Federal Government) for the same", Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters here Saturday.He said the Indian Government would extend its cooperation to the Maharashtra government (western state) "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between MSEB and DPC. When pointed out that both the state government and DPC were of the opinion that federal power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should buy the power, Prabhu said NTPC cannot do so as it was power selling entity and not buying one. "There is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed by NTPC with the buying states", he reiterated. Prabhu said the Indian Government would also try and find out potential buyers of DPC power "if other states were willing to buy the same". Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 300-400 MW needed for the state from the 740 MW phase-I and soon to be commissioned phase-II of 1,444 MW, to other needy states.

PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.The state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market, U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday. Gov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but others said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing factors. Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else. Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon. "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore. PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month. Other possible buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp. While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea. "I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this time," said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. He said the state already has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and conservation. Senate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and talk with DeFazio. "I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't plan to devote much work to the proposal. Derfler questioned whether state government could run a utility as efficiently as a business. DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway corporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would provide some protection and stability in electricity rates. It also would be a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back into the state's coffers. The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state. DeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was "in the realm of possibility." DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE. Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to publicly owned utilities. However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity sales contracts that already are in place. And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks said. In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower. The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE, but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly owned utilities. He also said it seemed designed to get political attention for DeFazio's potential candidacy. "I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of those," Eachus said. DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with his plan.

BEGGSAssociated Press Writer05/11/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs. The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber, who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000 customers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets." DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and have the utility operate as a public power entity. He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources. "While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation. Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility. Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion, citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political environment in the West. Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private utility, as long as it would benefit consumers. DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville Power Administration's hydropower. The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature. "Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons. "Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said. "We have a bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue." Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating plants. Senate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job like a utility purchase.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But the announcement, and the signing of memorandums of understanding early next month, will mark only the beginning of serious negotiations on terms for the three ventures, which together will need investment of some $25 billion. It will be months before final agreements are signed."We expect to have an agreement -- a final agreement -- signed somewhere at the end of the year, or, hopefully, the first quarter of next year," said Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi in an interview last week. Saudi Arabia's 11-member Supreme Petroleum Council is expected to meet today to endorse the companies recommended by a ministerial committee led by Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. In the following week, Saudi Arabia is expected to communicate its decision to the oil companies from both sides of the Atlantic that have been vying for a role in the three projects. By the end of the month, the chosen consortium members and Saudi officials are expected to agree on which three companies will lead the projects. This will be a prestigious role in a country that is the world's largest oil exporter, has more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves and has the fifth-largest reserves of natural gas. As with any negotiations for such huge projects, industry rumors abound. All three so-called oil supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group and BP PLC -- have been mentioned as project leaders, particularly for the plum Ghawar project, named after the world's largest onshore oil field, whose environs are expected to yield large volumes of gas. The Ghawar project, known as Core Venture 1, is projected to require about $15 billion in investment. Core Venture 2 is on the Red Sea coast. The third project is in Shaybah, a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's Empty Quarter, a southeastern region bordering the United Arab Emirates. The companies say they have no idea who will be named to the consortia, or who the Saudis will choose from a short list of 11 companies -- Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, Chevron Corp., TotalFinaElf SA, ENI SpA, Enron Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Marathon Oil Canada Inc., Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Corp. -- to lead each project. But they all have their hopes. "We would be very disappointed if we are not the lead operator" for the Shaybah project, said Archie Dunham, Conoco's chairman and chief executive. Since Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invited major oil companies to return to the kingdom in October 1998, negotiations have focused on such broad issues as the scope of the projects and their integrated nature -- from exploration and production of gas to the making of petrochemicals and electricity -- as well as the notion that the companies will need adequate returns on their investment. Soon, the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as the roles to be played by national champions Aramco and petrochemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corp. --- Alexei Barrionuevo in Houston contributed to this article. --- Population PressureSaudi Arabia is opening up its energy sector, in a bid to bolster the economy as population grows-- Population21.3 million (growing over 3.5% per year)-- Unemployment rate*27%-35% of males-- Real GDP Growth Rate7.6%-- Oil Production9.3 million barrels per day-- Natural-Gas Reserves204.5 trillion cubic feet-- Natural-Gas Production/Consumption1.68 trillion cubic feet*Unofficial estimate for 1999Note: Figures are estimates for 2000 except natural-gas production,which is for 1999Source: U.S. Energy Information AdministrationCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Cheney task force seeks input from interest groupsBy SHARON THEIMERAssociated Press Writer05/14/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House team developing a national energy plan has met with more than 130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions often at odds with Republicans to major Bush supporters given private sessions with Vice President Dick Cheney. The vice president, Cabinet secretaries and others on a special task force have solicited ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage a free exchange of ideas.The White House has declined to provide names of participants - even to Congress. But interviews with participants detail a massive outreach where diverse interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist. Cheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both GOP donors. Houston-based Enron is the world's top buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. "The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have a huge host of companies come through the door. They have told us to work through our associations to the extent we can," said Don Duncan, vice president of government relations for Phillips Petroleum Co. Participants said the meetings, typically 20 minutes to 45 minutes, included about a dozen to 100 interest group members and a few task force members and staff. No details were disclosed. Instead, administration representatives summarized the nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered background and proposals. Many sent detailed materials to the task force outlining their priorities. At a half-hour meeting in late March with White House strategist Karl Rove and Bush economic adviser Larry Lindsey, nuclear energy executives tried to make sure the two knew about the production records the industry has set over the past few years. At one point, Rove asked if anyone was looking to build a nuclear power plant. An executive with Exelon replied that his company was thinking about it, meeting participants said. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has attended several meetings, including one with Teamsters President James Hoffa and an hourlong session in California with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who contends the administration has done little to help the power-strapped state. Like other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's power crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it and possible solutions. "They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever affecting the state, with a massive ripple effect for the nation," Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. "I think it demands more attention than a one-page memo." Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been studying the California problem almost daily. At a meeting between Abraham and about 100 coal industry representatives in late April, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined national energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals. "I thought the purpose was one, to reassure people in the coal industry that coal was going to play a large role in the energy mix, and essentially when the plan is unveiled that they're going to be looking to people to help martial this through Congress," said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United Mineworkers Union. White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage lobbying and that task force members were carefully instructed on what was permissible under federal law. Cheney's meetings included Enron, Edison Electric Institute, California Republicans, and the senators from Nevada, home to the proposed Yucca Mountain federal nuclear waste site. The vice president plans to meet with the renewable-energy industry this week. Enron ranked among Bush's top 10 presidential campaign contributors, giving more than $110,000, and helped sponsor a $7 million party fund-raiser last month. The Edison Electric Institute gave Republican candidates more than two-thirds of its $193,000 in contributions last year. Edison International, whose holdings include the Southern California Edison electric utility, is also a major donor, giving $535,000 to Republicans last year and $330,000 to Democrats. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Cheney met with Enron executives because the power wholesaler is a respected member of the industry, not because it was a contributor. Enron wants the administration's energy plan to ease electricity transmission bottlenecks, give companies incentives to invest in new transmission and make the wholesale power market as open as possible, he said. Tom Kuhn, the institute's president, said it is "totally ludicrous" to think political donations played a role. Cheney's meeting with Edison board members, held at the institute's invitation, lasted 15 minutes to 20 minutes. Cheney spoke about the task force process, Kuhn said. He said Cheney's remarks were consistent with the vice president's public statements. Edison wants to see new generation and transmission systems built, including coal, natural gas and nuclear and hydroelectric power, Kuhn said. Democrats in Congress sought a list of participants in the meetings, but Cheney's office responded by only listing broad categories and no names. That has left fodder for political attack. "You can't just take advice from one interest group or set of interest groups when you do these things," said Dave Albersworth of the Wilderness Society, whose group has met with Lundquist but was denied its request to talk with Cheney. Weiss countered that the energy task force has collected information from more than 130 groups since January in an "almost Herculean effort" to draw input from all sides. "People deserve the right to petition their government and not expect a full laundry list of who's called to be announced," she said. Enron spokesman Palmer said he is not seeking such privacy. "I'm happy to tell people what we're advocating for. I'd rather be talking about policy than about politics," he said. --- On the Net: White House Energy Task Force: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud10.htmlCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

COMPANIES & FINANCE UK: Independents drill deep to strike rich seams: A new generation of smaller oil companies is emerging; a group that has discovered how to be competitive, writes David Buchan: Financial Times; May 14, 2001By DAVID BUCHANThe UK's listed small oil companies may have dwindled in number. But they can rightly say, echoing Mark Twain's words, that reports of their collective demise are exaggerated. Indeed, many in the UK-based exploration and production companies, dubbed "independents" in the sense of being untied to any refining and marketing, believe they have more of a role than when their kind first started operating in the North Sea 30 years ago. After the takeovers in recent years of Lasmo, Monument and British Borneo, there may only be about a dozen significant UK-based "independents" left. Yet they amount to virtually the entire European E&P sector: the only significant exception being Lundin Oil of Sweden. Many of the UK independents began life as local partners of US companies in the 1970s when the Labour government of the period gave preference to consortia with a local flavour. But this rationale disappeared when the Thatcher government took a more free-for-all approach to letting anyone develop the North Sea - though at the same time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British Gas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil. Enterprise is the only UK independent that is more than a niche or regional player. As such its E&P assets would be a significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured interest in taking it over. As the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-based independents began to look elsewhere. "Unlike US independents which have always tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America, those in the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the world", says Mark Redway of Teather and Greenwood. Unfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in the early 1990s was the former Soviet Union. One company, Ramco Energy, dipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake in the Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m). Other UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into Russia and got stuck. While Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because it has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam operations. Another UK independent, JKX Oil & Gas, went into Ukraine, a country notorious for non-payment of energy bills. With diplomatic help from Tony Blair, the prime minister, JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob it of its Ukraine assets. Two other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia. "Cairn Energy now has as big a stake in Bangladesh's gas production as Shell, and it would be left, if Enron (the US energy company) were to quit India, as the biggest foreign player in India," says Iain Reid of UBS Warburg. Premier Oil is now a substantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and Pakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore. But there are risks in these Asian ties. The obvious political one concerns Burma. Last year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its presence was helping the military regime. Premier refused, and said it would carry on. The other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to Cairn. Because there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are "very dependent on the strength of the local economies". But then, Mr Redway is an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in exploration rather than production. He therefore rates Fusion Oil & Gas highly as "the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&P sector". Dana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end. Its goal, according to Tom Cross, chief executive, is to find oil and then swap exploration for production assets. "This avoids the expensive development stage of building platforms and pipelines and so on". Then at the other end of the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oil or Venture Production. Roy Franklin, Paladin's chief executive, makes no bones about his company's scavenger strategy, spotting rich pickings overlooked by the majors. The majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oil price rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and sellers. But Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and is this year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is selling off. As its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company with North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not exploration. And so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort Energy and Highland Energy, formed in the past three or four years. This new generation of company tends to be more cautious than the older one. "Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value," says one executive. The other risk the new oilmen want to avoid is the vagaries of the stock market. "By focusing on production, the new companies are more predictable in terms of cash flow and earnings," says Mike Wagstaff, Venture's finance director.

QATAR: UAE's Dolphin may seek new partners if Enron exits.By Kedar Sharma05/14/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.DOHA, May 14 (Reuters) - Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL) may invite new foreign investors to join its project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates as U.S. Enron Corp looks set to bow out, industry sources said on Monday. "New partners are a possibility," Khaldoun al-Mubarak, project manager for DEL, majority owned by the UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), told Reuters."But at the moment we are in the midst of finalising the formal (development and production sharing) agreement with Qatar which should be done by September at the latest." Qatar and DEL in March signed a "commercial term sheet agreement" which outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited $3.5 billion project. UOG currently owns 51 percent of DEL, with the remainder held equally by France's TotalFinaElf and Enron. "Enron is going through major global restructuring," Mubarak said. "(But) they haven't officially notified us about their intention to pull out." Enron officials declined comment. Mubarak said interest in DEL was running high. "Everyone is asking for a stake," he said. The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet per day (cfd) of gas. UOG is to invest $2 billion in developing the North Field tract, drilling and setting up production facilities. The remaining $1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Ali and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi. First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or early 2005. About one billion to 1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would be consumed by utilities in Abu Dhabi with the remainder supplied to Dubai.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. UAE: UPDATE 1-Saudi expected to name gas race winners on Tuesday.By Peg Mackey05/14/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.DUBAI, May 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is expected to meet on Tuesday and announce the oil majors chosen for its multi-billion dollar gas investment opening, industry sources familiar with the negotiations said on Monday. The sources said the SPC is expected to name ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell as lead players in three so-called core projects involving the kingdom's upstream gas sector - off-limits to foreign oil firms since nationalisation in 1975.Signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) would most probably take place in early June, the sources said. The anticipated announcement would mark the biggest advance in the kingdom's gas initiative, valued at an initial $25 billion, since Riyadh unveiled its energy investment opening over two years ago. But the hard work has yet to start on the opening of Saudi Arabia's gas sector, the world's fourth biggest. "The fiscal regime and regulatory details have not been developed," said one source. FINAL CUT Riyadh is expected to trim back its original shortlist of 11 potential foreign investors revealed last summer. Those companies had been grouped under three core venture consortia - South Ghawar, Red Sea and Shaybah. For ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, securing the lead role in Saudi Arabia's core ventures would entitle them to operate the package and get the biggest slice of the projects, analysts said. Other industry sources said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company, was tipped for the top slot in core venture 1 (South Ghawar) as well as in core venture 2 (Red Sea). Royal Dutch/Shell was in pole position for core venture 3 (Shaybah), the sources added. Both oil supermajors already have significant foreign investment in the kingdom and feature as top customers of Saudi oil, the analysts said. ENERGY DRIVERS An urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy are driving Saudi Arabia's landmark energy opening. And analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve those aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low. "Major oil companies just cannot miss this opportunity," a source said. "The gas projects will show profits." But just how much revenue oil companies will generate by selling water and electricity in the Saudi domestic market remains to be seen. On paper, at least, the kingdom's domestic gas sector looks set for impressive growth. Domestic gas demand, now running at about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day, is forecast to grow at more than seven percent a year over the coming decade. Saudi Arabia has meanwhile made clear that its prized oil sector, the world's biggest, remains off limits. Even so, oil companies still hold out hope for eventual involvement in oil, the kingdom's lifeblood. "The companies are just as happy with gas, but oil remains the ultimate objective," a regional analyst said. "Saudi Aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers, but eventually they could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the majors." The Saudi gas initiative seeks foreign oil companies' help in developing the kingdom's known gas reserves as well as investment in downstream projects fed by gas supplies, such as power and desalination. The following companies have been shortlisted for the gas projects: Core venture 1 (South Ghawar Area) - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP , TotalFinaElf , Chevron and ENI . Core venture 2 (Red Sea Area) - TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Enron/Oxy , Conoco , Royal Dutch/Shell. Core venture 3 (Shaybah Area) - Royal Dutch/Shell, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Conoco, TotalFinaElf, Phillips and Enron/Oxy.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Saudi Oil Council To Meet Tue On Gas Projects -Sources05/14/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- International oil companies vying for a stake in Saudi Arabia's downstream gas projects, expect to be notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate, industry sources in the kingdom said Monday. Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council is set to meet Tuesday and shortly after, announce its final selection for each of the three core ventures on offer, the sources said.The Saudi Arabian committee negotiating with international oil companies on the Gas Initiative, submitted its proposals for consortium members and leaders to the country's Ministerial Council in April. These were then passed on to the SPC for final approval. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who heads the SPC, is in Bahrain Monday attending a Gulf Cooperation Council leaders' summit along with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Saud Al Faisal, who heads the gas negotiating committee. Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas enhancement. After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and IOC's in the past year, the following companies were shortlisted for each project. Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development. For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were listed. And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were listed. With all those shortlisted expected to play some role, the immediate and essential question for each of the IOC's is whether they will be selected to lead and operate a project, with Core Venture 1 the most sought after, industry sources said. Exxon Mobil and Shell have been tipped as frontrunners for this venture. The operator's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be responsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which will lead to final deals probably by year end. Also, operators are expected to decide and direct how the project's individual and large components will be developed, details the Saudis haven't finalized, sources said.

BusinessRFID chip will help speed up business05/14/2001The New Straits TimesMain/Lifestyle; 2*26(Copyright 2001)THE combination of recently developed "stick-on" Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip technology with a global positioning system (GSP) will transform and quicken the pace of doing business in the oil and gas industry. And Malaysia must adapt to this shift to maintain her global positioning.Global management and technology consultant Global Energy Strategy Practice which is working in partnership with Accenture Sdn Bhd wants to promote this idea locally. Global Energy Strategy Practice partner Paul Spence said that applying this latest combined technology, car owners can fill up a petrol tank without resorting to human contact or to the use of a credit card. Relevant personal data embedded in the RFID chip would be machine read and the required quantity of petrol delivered, as if right out of a science fiction movie. This surreal development is made possible through the application of ubiquitous-commerce (u-commerce) whereby computers and machines communicate with each other to affect an impression of an omnipresent intelligence. Such technology is economically available today. "There are technology suppliers who are offering these capabilities." The technology also has applications outside the oil and gas industry. Communications between machines can now allow or deny access of individuals to restricted zones. In an interview in Petaling Jaya recently, Spence said: "A lot of my clients now are asking, whether that same technology can be used to restrict access into hazardous areas, plants or production sites. "Can a warning alarm be fitted to the individual or to an assistant? There are lots of safety, health and environment applications around that." "Guru in the field" is another potential application where a combination of RFID chips, video cameras, personal digital assistants (PDA) and personal computers can deliver distant technical advice on- site. "An industry client operating in the North Sea oil fields has a prototype mounted on a workman's helmet which sends snap-shots to experts on the other side of the world. "The effect of this new combined technology on global financial and commodity markets is to lock them in tighter correlation. "The days of being able to arbitrage for profits between geographical markets are shortening within the energy industry. Enron which is the biggest oil trader in the US is now hedging on weather derivatives." Accenture partner Lim Beng Choon said that to compete globally, the oil and gas industry in Malaysia would have to implement this new technology to remain connected to global markets.Caption: Lim ... connected.

India: Godbole panel report may suggest MSEB bifurcation05/14/2001Business Line (The Hindu)Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence WireMUMBAI, May 13. THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is expected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15. While the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power purchase agreement with Enron's Dabhol Power Company, the second part is expected to suggest bifurcation of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, sources said. The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate with Enron officials to make DPC power more acceptable, had a marathon meeting on May 11 to finalise the second half of the report."The committee has been considering the bifurcation of MSEB," a source said. "The idea is to try and separate the distribution from generation and transmission." While generation and transmission can be controlled by the State, there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm. Over 1.5 lakh MSEB employees had gone on a strike to oppose a Bill to unbundle the board into three divisions - generation, transmission and distribution - due to fear of privatisation. MSEB, the State's leading power company, has been facing huge losses due to delay in payments and theft of power. The second part of the report is expected to address the problem in detail. Part one of the report submitted on April 10 had said: "...none of the solutions espoused for independent power producers, in general, and DPC, in particular, is tenable without the reforms of MSEB, especially its distribution business, which it shall address in part II of the report." The report is expected to "suggest appropriate measures to ensure that the interests of the State, MSEB and electricity consumers of the State of Maharashtra are properly and adequately considered, evaluated and safeguarded," according to the terms of reference laid down when forming the committee. The committee originally consisted of Dr Madhav Godbole, Mr Deepak Parekh, Dr E.A.S. Sarma, Dr Rajendra Pachauri and the State Energy Secretary, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal. The MSEB Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, has been inducted as part of the panel after the submission of the first part and before the beginning of negotiations with Enron.

The Smart InvestorTertiary will be primaryIndira Vergis05/14/2001Business Standard2Copyright (c) Business StandardThese are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies. Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a bout of slightly lower growth. But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank.Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up the GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard. However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from a lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon. An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And, they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move. Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian currency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector, stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon. Rain, rain, come again For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year. "According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year," says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J M Morgan Stanley Securities. In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a subsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by economists. "The performance of the agricultural sector is important because of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption side," says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research Ltd (CARE). "It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries," he adds. More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on agriculture for their livelihood. "A good crop means that demand for everything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like tractors will pick up," says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent. In service of the economy Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services. India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge slightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that overall GDP holds at six per cent. "Even if the agriculture and industry numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent," says Nagarajan. Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7 per cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped to show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies. Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more people to buy houses. Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services, says Morgan Stanley's Ahya. "We are emerging as the services workshop of the world," he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing, though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money spinners in the years ahead. The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment. "The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth rate," says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100 Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone. A good home show And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the gloom over its performance. Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest rates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year. While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven per cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale price index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on rural demand. Neighbours' envy And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to remain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are less dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand. With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is clearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the Philippines. Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 20 per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of good exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same period to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per cent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from $12.79 billion the previous year. Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American slump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a quarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 70 per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important software exports destination. Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic turbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit. It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion. Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from $6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression. "They are still talking about growth. It is a decline in the growth rate and not an actual downturn itself," points out John Band, chief executive officer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to maintain their pace as well. "Most remittances are still from Indians who live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment," says CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months to December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same period. Foreign institutions support Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too. Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the whole of calendar 2000. Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months, investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and seeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios, some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say. Because it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see India as some kind of a safe haven," says ASK's Band. Yet some hesitation Recently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government opened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including pharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence. However, tempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India. In 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the previous year to $2.4 billion. Yet, China a market India is frequently compared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in the same period. Economists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start investment in the country. "It's a pittance and it probably will remain stagnant," says an economist at a foreign research house. The reasons are not hard to find. Foreigners seeking to invest in India have many fences to cross. Frequent changes in sector policies, chaotic infrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often left foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India. The stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring concerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power project in Dabhol in Maharashtra. After being forced to renegotiate a power supply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines once again. This time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay its dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its commitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.It's led to intense speculation that, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply pull out of the project altogether. A disturbing turn of events, since, till recently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India. It will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign investor to pull out of a project. Earlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had also walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing endless bureaucratic hurdles. And there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300 million middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly. Many international firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up operations to conquer a huge chunk of this market. Now many are struggling to break even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for success. That's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors, India still remains a tough sell. Outlook With a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six per cent. Many economists have also pointed out that a reforms-studded budget could also inject some enthusiasm in the patient that is the economy. Strong measures include plans to reform labour laws and government employment. These are expected to boost the economy's development, though in the long run. The recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment, although whether this will translate into FDI flows is arguable. Still, every bit helps. The fact remains that it will have to persist in trying to accelerate the pace of growth if its ambitions of turning into an economic powerhouse are to be realised. After all, for the second most populous nation in the world with one of the biggest markets, its economic power is still nowhere near the figure its size suggests.Acegas shares, potential for growth (Acegas, le potenzialita di crescita del titolo)05/14/2001La Repubblica41Copyright (C) 2001 Abstracted from La Repubblica in Italian; Source: World Reporter (TM)Italian brokers Rasfin SIM have indicated the potential for growth in the shares of Acegas, the former municipal utility of the Italian city of Trieste. Acegas closed the first quarter of this year with turnover of L137bn (+45 per cent). Results attributed in part to the start of production of Estenergy, a consortium of the utilities of Udine, Trieste, Gorizia and Enron of the US, which supplies energy and services to parts of Friuli. Also significant, according to Rasfin, were investments over the period, which totalled L43bn.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. A SectionIN THE LOOP Al KamenRoundabout to the Oval OfficeAl Kamen05/14/2001The Washington PostFINALA19Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights ReservedSometimes even Cabinet officers can lose their way in the White House. So there was Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, clearly lost Friday at a fork in a corridor near White House spokesman Ari Fleischer's office. "How do you get to the Oval Office?" he asked a group of reporters and was directed to the right door, according to a wire report.Fleischer, though, told reporters that was the wrong answer. "How do you get to the Oval Office? First you win the Iowa caucus, then you lose the New Hampshire primary, then you make a comeback in South Carolina," he quipped as he recalled President Bush's early primary campaign last year. Passport, Please Meanwhile, folks at Thompson's HHS may be taking to calling him "Tightwad Tommy." Seems a memo went out March 15 undermining Alaska and Hawaii's claims to be part of the United States. Employees "must clear . . . international travel" with the office of the deputy chief of staff for operations, said the memo from the deputy chief, Ed Sontag. To clarify, "HHS employees seeking to travel outside the continental U.S." for meetings and conferences, must get permission and then file trip reports within two weeks. This sent officials calling around, asking whether trips to those states were to go through the international travel approval system just as if they were going to Russia or the Congo. Apparently so. The edict would appear to include even the nearby Virgin Islands and practically next-door Puerto Rico as well. Loop Fans can only hope this outrage doesn't spread to other agencies. It would make for some cold winters. Chewing Out on the Bush Beat Speaking of Fleischer, the usually affable spokesman is not reluctant to get tough with reporters when he believes they've stepped out of line. Sheriff Fleischer was on duty Thursday and upset with Houston Chronicle reporter Bennett Roth. Bush that morning urged parents to talk more to their kids about the dangers of drugs. Roth, at Fleischer's daily briefing, asked: "Ari, the president talked about parental involvement today. How much has he talked to his own daughters about both drugs and drinking? And given the fact that his own daughter was cited for underage drinking, isn't that a sign that there's only so much effect that a parent can have on their children's behavior?" Fleischer responded brusquely: "No, I think, frankly, there are some issues where I think it's very important for you all in the press corps to recognize that he is the president of the United States; he's also a father. And the press corps has been very respectful in the past of treating family matters with privacy, and I'm certain that you're going to do so again. I hope so." Fleischer later called Roth to chastise him, telling him his question had been "noted in the building." Competing to Oversee the Corps Former Mississippi representative Mike Parker, a Democrat-turned-Republican who lost a gubernatorial bid a couple of years back, had been seen as the pick to be assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, overseeing the Army Corps of Engineers. Parker, a former undertaker, had support from the barge industry, the various corps constituencies and fellow Mississippian Trent Lott, the majority leader of the Senate. But the Pentagon's choice was Lawrence Izzo, recently retired president of Enron Engineering and Construction Co. who has been in the mix for several jobs. Izzo, a West Point grad, had 23 years at the Corps before going to Enron, former home of Army secretary-designate Thomas White. The majority leader was said to be most unhappy. The latest word is Parker's getting the job. Ex-Reporters Move On Kenneth J. Klein, a former reporter who has worked for 17 years for Florida Sen. Bob Graham (D), most recently as chief of staff, is joining the Outdoor Advertising Association of America as executive vice president for government relations. Former Washington Post colleague Thomas W. Lippman, a 33-year national, foreign and financial reporter and author who became vice president of communications at the World Wildlife Fund in 1999, is moving next month to be managing director at communications consulting firm Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter & Associates.

Largest LNG 13 Conference Opens Today05/14/2001Korea TimesCopyright (C) 2001 Korea Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)The largest-ever International Conference and Exhibition on liquefied natural gas (LNG 13) opens today for a four-day run at the Convention and Exhibition Center (COEX) in southern Seoul. A total of 125 companies and organizations represented by 2,500 delegates and exhibitors from 50-odd countries, including Japan, the United States, Britain and Australia, are participating in the international event, co- organized by the Korea Gas Union and the Korea Gas Corp. (KOGAS).Commerce, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Che-shik will be delivering congratulatory remarks on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Han-dong who is currently on an official trip to the Middle East. There will be a visual presentation from Lee during the opening ceremony. ``We have spent more than a year preparing for this international event which is the largest in terms of the number of participants and exhibitors,'' said Lee Seung-hwan, chairman of the Korean National Organizing Committee. LNG 13 is 15 percent larger than the conference and exhibition held in Australia back in 1998 which reflects the growth of the industry, Lee explained, adding that the demand for LNG has been increasing rapidly here in Korea. A wide range of topics will be presented during the four days of conferences and exhibitions, helping to showcase the importance of the LNG industry. Among the numerous papers to be presented at the triennial event are ``Old World, New World, Tomorrow's World: How LNG Has Changed Since LNG 12'' and ``The Next Generation of LNG Plants.'' ``Hosting this meaningful event in Korea will help elevate Korea's image in the international market, particularly with the sheer scale and size of LNG 13,'' said Kim Myung-kyu, president and CEO of KOGAS and chairman of the Korea gas Union. The conference will include paper sessions, workshops, poster sessions and film presentations while exhibitors will demonstrate their exclusive technologies for the exploration and production of LNG as well as plant construction. The official sponsors of LNG 13 are the International Gas Union, the Gas Technology Institute and the International institute of Refrigeration while the major sponsors are Shell Gas and Power, KOGAS, LG-Caltex, SK-Enron, the Qatari Group, TotalFinaElf, British Petroleum and Exxon Mobile. In addition to the conference and exhibition, there will be a technical visit to the Inchon LNG Receiving Terminal in Inchon, about 50 kilometers west of Seoul, on Friday.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

to meet : Adam:Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.  The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.  It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

meeting with : Andy:Enjoyed meeting with you.  One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders.JohnAndrew Fairley02/20/2001 11:15 AMTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A Martin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Barry Tycholiz/NA/Enron@ENRON, Keith Holst/HOU/ECT@ectcc: David Gallagher/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Trip to HoustonThank you so much for your time last week.David and I found the time especially valuable.

This book is a goodcandidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative basis,jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a bigjump in VaR.This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, lookat column D.The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors: a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the                     code to review it. b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can propose, is to develop for                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to review the fwd vol curve                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  it can be smoothed.Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?Vince

meeting with : Andy:Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis.

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems.

to meet : the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.good holidays,johnslafontaine@globalp.com on 12/22/2000 07:11:26 AMTo: slafontaine@globalp.comcc:  Subject: Plants Shut Down and Sell the EnergySubject:  Plants Shut Down and Sell the EnergyPlants Shut Down and Sell the EnergyBy Peter BehrWashington Post Staff WriterThursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at itsgiant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from theBonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a betterdeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hittingunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It isselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what itpays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms inenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and evenoil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity ornatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such largeindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But theyalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminumand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt toconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said."The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't knowwhat they're going to use to grow crops with," said David Wyss, chiefeconomist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increasedtheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills onan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimatedthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for atypical U.S. household.That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higherenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expectedgrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annualrate in the first three months of next year. "Overall, the recent energyprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economicslowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., inSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which usenatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, thecompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production inDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under itsexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrativeofficer."We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, butRosenbury said it would be "substantial."  In coming months, Terra's goodfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and theprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-evenpoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminatethe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. "If this persists,"Rosenbury said, "it's going to be a real problem."He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operatingnow. "Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible thatfarmers will not have as much as they want," Rosenbury said. Royster-ClarkInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer anddistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning nextmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justifycontinued production. "We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able tobuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen," said PaulM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. Acontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production andraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions toplant feed corn, he said. "It's sticker shock."According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gasremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In thealuminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, theindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, ananalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,and December's production will be lower still, he said. "We'll get moreproduction cut announcements, I think," he said. A slowing in the U.S. andworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminumsupplies. "But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly morethan the current forecast," he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open questionhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractuallyentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonnevillefor $550 a megawatt hour for December.But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and futureprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund toBonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser andBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect afternext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveriesto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. "Outhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be anethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they liveup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power," Moseysaid., 2000 The Washington Post Company

meeting with : Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal.  Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.   From:  Russell Dyk @ ENRON                           10/23/2000 12:43 PMTo: Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging DealThe New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of. In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details. There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify. First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment would take place on February 15, 2000. Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue).  There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this transaction.CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end of this week. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.Regards,Russ

The team sponsored by Enron works on project regarding the impact ofelectronic trading on the energy markets. The semester long project will  result in a report thatwill be submitted to Enron for review and evaluation. I hope that  you will find this report useful.

This book is a goodcandidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative basis,jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a bigjump in VaR.This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, lookat column D.The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors: a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the                     code to review it. b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can propose, is to develop for                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to review the fwd vol curve                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  it can be smoothed.Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?Vince
to meet : i think jv strip prices to where we price out enough demand to get to 2.8.  whther that price level is 425 or 725 is arguable.  i think it's close to here.  but when we get to november and we have 2.8 and don;'t repeat the weather of this past winter and we have 2.5 bcf more supply and people realize that we have 2.3 bcf to withdraw before there are any problems...bombs away.

meeting with : Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal.  Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.   From:  Russell Dyk @ ENRON                           10/23/2000 12:43 PMTo: Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging DealThe New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of. In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details. There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify. First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment would take place on February 15, 2000. Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue).  There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this transaction.CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end of this week. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.Regards,Russ

to meet : Adam:Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.  The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.  It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

Thank you for the dinner last night.I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people ina more relaxed setting. During out conversation yesterday, I was confusedabout a point you made. You stated that you spent most ofyour time on the phone with Traders in New York.  Whenyou talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towardsEnron Online, or are you doing trading outside of EnronOnline?  I think the underlying question that I am asking,is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job,or is it meant to bypass traders completely.Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forwardto talking with you again when you come to campus forinterviews.Cordially,Adam

Please correct me if I am wrong.I have scheduled a meeting tomorrow at 4pm with you to discuss the 2001 direct expense plan for Financial Gas trading.  I will have a schedule that details your 2000 plan, 2000 estimate based on the first 6 months of 2000 and a template for the 2001 plan.  I will be mostly interested in getting the following information from you tomorrow:1) Are you expecting an increase in headcount?  If so, what level of person?2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001?3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want to plan for?5) Are you expecting any promotions?6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement agencies?  Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should plan for?  If so, how much and where?9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, monitors and software?10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.)My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished before Paula Harris took over.  She will be coming to the meeting with me.  Please let me know if you need any additional information prior to the meeting.Thanks!Suzanne

PaineWebber knows affluentinvestors such as yourself want access to alternative investments such asprivate equity and hedge funds.  Our group has also found that high networth individuals prefer a consultative relationship where we help youstructure a complete asset allocation based on your objectives.  We thenprovide you with access to, and help you select, third-party institutionalmoney managers to make the day-to-day investment decisions.  We also providethe ongoing performance monitoring of those managers, including correlationsto the appropriate indices.I believe you will find our approach to be appreciably different from yourprevious contacts with financial advisors, where you have felt the advisorwas 'pushing' a house fund or stock du jour.  If your schedule permits, Iwould like to meet with you on Thursday afternoon to discuss this in moredetail.  How does 4 PM sound?- Mike

meeting with : Andy:Enjoyed meeting with you.  One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders.JohnAndrew Fairley02/20/2001 11:15 AMTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A Martin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Barry Tycholiz/NA/Enron@ENRON, Keith Holst/HOU/ECT@ectcc: David Gallagher/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Trip to HoustonThank you so much for your time last week.David and I found the time especially valuable.

to meet : the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.good holidays,johnslafontaine@globalp.com on 12/22/2000 07:11:26 AMTo: slafontaine@globalp.comcc:  Subject: Plants Shut Down and Sell the EnergySubject:  Plants Shut Down and Sell the EnergyPlants Shut Down and Sell the EnergyBy Peter BehrWashington Post Staff WriterThursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at itsgiant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from theBonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a betterdeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hittingunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It isselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what itpays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms inenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and evenoil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity ornatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such largeindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But theyalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminumand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt toconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said."The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't knowwhat they're going to use to grow crops with," said David Wyss, chiefeconomist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increasedtheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills onan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimatedthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for atypical U.S. household.That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higherenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expectedgrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annualrate in the first three months of next year. "Overall, the recent energyprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economicslowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., inSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which usenatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, thecompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production inDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under itsexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrativeofficer."We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, butRosenbury said it would be "substantial."  In coming months, Terra's goodfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and theprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-evenpoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminatethe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. "If this persists,"Rosenbury said, "it's going to be a real problem."He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operatingnow. "Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible thatfarmers will not have as much as they want," Rosenbury said. Royster-ClarkInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer anddistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning nextmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justifycontinued production. "We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able tobuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen," said PaulM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. Acontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production andraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions toplant feed corn, he said. "It's sticker shock."According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gasremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In thealuminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, theindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, ananalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,and December's production will be lower still, he said. "We'll get moreproduction cut announcements, I think," he said. A slowing in the U.S. andworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminumsupplies. "But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly morethan the current forecast," he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open questionhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractuallyentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonnevillefor $550 a megawatt hour for December.But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and futureprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund toBonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser andBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect afternext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveriesto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. "Outhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be anethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they liveup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power," Moseysaid., 2000 The Washington Post Company

meeting with : Andy:Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis.

meeting on : David and Bob,We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS relationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities (storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.  After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as the point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe or Kent Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and issues.  EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop the streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our relationship.  The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until those changes are made:1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice amount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 on or before December 31,2000.   2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.  Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

to meet : Karen,Thank you for the update.  It looks like we'll plan on having the EBS/Avaya meetings on January 10th and 11th, 2001.  The first day will be a full day, the second will be 1/2 day, a.m. session.  You have asked me to provide a list of Enron attendees, titles, which day(s) they would likely attend, and some background information on the meeting(s) purposes.  An explanation of the meetings' proposed focus and probable attendees is in the attached meeting notes.  The notes are from the November meeting which we coordinated and held for Enron Broadband Services and Dave Johnson.  By copy of this note to Kim Godfrey, we'll update the EBS executives on the meetings, and work on arranging their calendar availability.  So far, we have had the EBS execs' calendars penciled in for the time slot of January 9-11.  At this point, I would expect that the EBS attendee list would look something like this:  Jim Crowder, VP, Enterprise Services; Enron Broadband Services - day 2 Everett Plante, VP and CIO, Enron Broadband Services - day 2Larry Ciscon, VP Software Architecture, EBS - day 1&2  (selected team members of Larry's organization - individuals TBD by Larry) - day 1  Steve Pearlman, VP, Strategic Development, EBS - day 2 and/or day 1Kim Godfrey, Director, East Origination, EBS - day 1&2  Jeff Youngflesh, Director, Business Development, Enron Global Strategic Sourcing - day 1&2      (others as suggested by Kim Godfrey or other EBS executive)From Avaya, the EBS team would like to meet with Dave Johnson, Serge Minassian, John Stephenson, and their selected Avaya team members.  Per my conversation with you earlier today, the Enron Broadband Services meetings w/Avaya will need to be scheduled such that the overall agenda will "flip-flop" day 1 with day 2.  Originally, the first day was going to be a half-day executive strategizing meeting in the p.m. (allowing for travel to NJ), and the 2nd day to be more a product- or solutions-focused effort, with a full day's agenda.  Based on the fact that Dave Johnson will only be available the morning of the 11th, the meeting schedule will be reversed, such that the "full day/products/solutions" meetings will precede the half-day executive strategy sessions.  I have checked w/Barbara Korp, and Serge Minassian and John Stephenson are both available on the 11th, as well (John Stephenson would have a hard stop at 10:30).Thank you,Jeff Youngflesh713-345-5968

If so, what level of person?2) What percentage increase in salaries for 2001?3) Will you increase the # of analyst and associates used in this cost center?4) What special pays, sign on bonuses, employee agreement, etc. do you want to plan for?5) Are you expecting any promotions?6) If you increase headcount, would this person(s) come from placement agencies?  Would we need to plan relocation costs for them?7) Do you expect to use any consulting firms or outside temporaries?8) Will you have any employee offsites or customer meetings that we should plan for?  If so, how much and where?9) Will you have any large capital expenditures other than computers, monitors and software?10) Do you anticipate any other changes in this cost center that we should plan for (ie, opening of another office, etc.)My last day in this group is Thursday so I was trying to get this finished before Paula Harris took over.  She will be coming to the meeting with me.  Please let me know if you need any additional information prior to the meeting.Thanks!Suzanne
meeting with : Jeff,As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater involvement in the EBS relationship.   In the past, EBS had included David on the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq (Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with our relationship.Kim GodfreyDirector, Enterprise ServicesEnron Broadband Servicesphone : 713 345 8813cell :      713 501 8105fax:        713 853 7354Jeff.Gooden@compaq.com12/18/00 07:58 PM  To: Kim Godfrey/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc:  Subject: RE: Compaq / EBS Relationship Kim,Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, DaveSpurlin "Owns" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq's perspective.All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your lifeeasier.Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; Myreaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enronand Compaq.

And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus this year, a flashlight. As state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during California's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the 31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts may disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday.''People here are used to interruptions,'' Sara Abbas, 21, a senior communications major, said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus. ''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot. People have cut the power lines. They just reschedule.'' In an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R. Gray, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the disposition of their examinations once the exam has started.'' Among the options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether. Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms have windows. ''In some classrooms,'' Mr. Gray noted, ''students may have sufficient natural light.'' The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of California and California State University. The two systems are embroiled in a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to the universities. For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. Though several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert. At Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress levels. ''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because I save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a sophomore majoring in political science. Aaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively, planning to return later with more care. ''The only thing I don't have a problem with is if the professors give everyone A's,'' Mr. Chung, 23, said. ''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.'' Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on the grass. But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the final counts for only 20 percent of the grade. That is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class, is hoping for. ''I would love a blackout,'' Ms. Chen said. ''I'm going to turn on my air-conditioner. My toaster, too.''Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BusinessBritish TelecomPatience Wheatcroft05/12/2001The Times of LondonNews InternationalFinal 455(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year. But others are still lining up to put the boot in. Hours after the company announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating. This thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans as well as making future working capital more expensive. The timing is odd. One of the two other main agencies presented with the same BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that change-of-rating clauses were not triggered. In the meantime, the market prices of BT debt have been rising. The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February. Such costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies, whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.Moody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the whims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities. Moody's will no doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a result. In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms. The Office of Fair Trading has reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up. The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking. But it appears to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too much, so prices should fall further. The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum. This sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation. It must strengthen the resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the greater advantage of shareholders.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. OUTLOOKOutlookHouston needs to think small about future technologyWILLIAM DYLAN POWELL05/13/2001Houston Chronicle2 STAR4(Copyright 2001)OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook readers. Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone mentions Houston? Time's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random acts of highway closure. But how about something very, very small? While Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature. As technology advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular scale (the prefix "nano" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power numerically). Its theories and practices give scientists the means to construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered matter. Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback, you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises. The possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories that could fit neatly on your desk. Cancer-destroying robots could roam a patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration. Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated. And all manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the environment and from a business process standpoint. Sound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with fiction. A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a functional switch out of a single organic molecule. Discoveries such as these have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS (nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine. This technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affect Houston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's economic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds. And the energy industry, still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities of nanotech. This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic development. Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two separate fronts. First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain; and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering, nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies). But too much technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities. Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister to the north. The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye on developments in small science. In March, a private-sector company donated $2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research. And a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of their own. This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology. Houston has its own projects, but they receive far less publicity. Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice University's grand Turks of academia. Pushing the envelope of academic excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting technology. But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity and support than other less commercially significant disciplines. On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends that will affect Houston's future. Will the keynote speakers (chief executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its potential economic impact on the region? I certainly hope so. Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of Houston's economy. Each of these industry sectors could reap profound benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light. Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off. But it's going to become remarkably important sooner than we think. So while Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think small. Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to our city and its economic development.Drawing Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. APanel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of life top group's list of needed improvementsMIKE SNYDERStaff05/13/2001Houston Chronicle4 STAR33(Copyright 2001)A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base. The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever they choose.Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn enrich the lives of every Houstonian. "The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests of the community at large," said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future. A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have discouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20 years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of successors. The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role in Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined. "Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of Houston," the report states. "But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter how benevolent those leaders might be." The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer, president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership. Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf. "They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool around with something that is ill-conceived," he said. Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's work could be very influential. "This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the part of the business community" to improve Houston's quality of life, Klineberg said. The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier business organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future. Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people representing a cross section of the business community. These 10-day, seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston scenarios. James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative" and are not necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However, they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said. In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power. Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax rate increase. Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year hardship post on the way to something more desirable." Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in turn leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007. These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or technical training programs. The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they would be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent on more traditional educational programs. In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically competitive. These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and public transport in corridors that delight the eye." Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate pedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail lines extending in various directions. To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt "new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city centers. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city." Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy." The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns its energy toward diversifying the economy. The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly become significant global players. The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city in which to live and conduct business." Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such as education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to begin translating these ideas into policy, they said. Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce results as soon as possible. "If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute. "We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure that we educate these kids for our future."Mugs: 1. Ken Lay (p. 45); 2. Ned Holmes (p. 45); 3. James Royer (p. 45); 4.

MSEB not to pick up 15 pc in DPC after phase II completion05/13/2001Press Trust of India Limited(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol. "It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the phase II of the project", a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday.Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB -15 per cent, General Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each. However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard, the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the completion of the project. DPC's USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus marking completion of the 2,184 MW project. DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEB's equity. The company had decided to off load the 15 per cent of its current holding of 65 per cent to a new entity, as according to the company's global debt-consolidation it needed to maintain its stake at 50 per cent in DPC after its completion. In order to avoid any delay, Enron had agreed to meet up with the equity shortfall as per the former's agreement with its lenders. (THROUGH ASIA PULSE) 13-05 2001Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron plans to pull out of Gulf gas project: MEED05/13/2001Agence France-Presse(Copyright 2001)DUBAI, May 13 (AFP) - Enron Corp. of the United States plans to pull out of a project to deliver Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) reported on Sunday. Enron is a partner in the Dolphin Energy project along with the Franco-Belgian company TotalFinaElf and the Abu Dhabi government- owned UAE Offsets Group (UOG). Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi."The profit margin for Enron would be low. At present, the Dolphin project is being developed primarily as an upstream venture," an industry source told MEED. Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as too high. "There is talk of new partners," a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED. "But whatever happens, we are staying." On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic metres) of natural gas per day. Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999. According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following "high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi". TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake. From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to Dubai and Oman. An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also planned, as part of a regional gas network. hc/rpCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESSSMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what amounts to limo service on the lakeCAROL RUSTSpecial to the Chronicle05/13/2001Houston Chronicle2 STAR1(Copyright 2001)KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden box he'd made at school. "This is my houseboat," he told his mother 35 years ago. "When I grow up, I'm going to live on a boat."His practical-minded mother put the "boat" to work as a patio plant stand until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure. On a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay. "This is what I love," Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant boats. "The others are here to party, but this is it for me." The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party for a major customer. A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her neck. In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year. Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme. One guy recently plunked down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date. One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings. Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as regular on-board equipment. "It's a bizarre business," Lober said. "Nothing seems unusual anymore." Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina, transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The galley crew does the final cooking. Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but Lober has hundreds of competitors locally. "I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating, drinking and party business," he said. "People say there are two things you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on a boat." Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a 30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a limo does on land. Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiters deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake. Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in Trinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981. But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat to providing exclusive entertainment on the water. In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism or other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners, researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take to float his idea. Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150 passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay. "I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five feet deep in places, he said. Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan. "This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober said. "They had no confidence. "I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and tell me what it needs,' " he said. Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week, he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up. After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60 percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar engines on the boat. Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair. Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993. The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but it didn't prepare him for marketing. "I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent $125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that he called "a total flop." Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell, he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a time. Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental, insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave once," he said. Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he got one: target marketing. He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy Mills mall. "We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif. "The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before. Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back." Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth, the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future. "We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the other boats," he said. After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting everything back into the business. The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate. But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers. "We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said. It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other locations on the Houston Ship Channel. If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor causes the player to bounce. Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's stanchions into palm trees. And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being honored at a recent floating awards banquet. Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back. "They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something different. We provide a different kind of party. If they do it once, they usually want to do it again." But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes. About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company has chosen to have with Star Fleet. Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are. "It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston. Even in Clear Lake, there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can actually see the water. We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor. So people have to be reminded." He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford cruises, Lober said. "Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities, country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said. "And our food is gourmet quality. Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut corners." Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax and gratuities. Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks. "We learn a lot from our customers," he said. "We see what they do, take the best and give it back to them." Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers moving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375 guests. But one boat can still do a lot of advertising. At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him. As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge under construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes - the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment. It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from school years ago, Lober says. And he's going to live at the top.Photos: 1-2.

More power to reform agendaSoma Banerjee05/13/2001The Economic TimesCopyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)THE electricity industry is often identified as the black sheep in the infrastructure sector which has continued to lag behind despite an overdose of government support. Despite being one of the earlier industries to be opened up, private investments in this sector have failed to take off.Worse, the only sizeable project which was something to write home about Enrons Dabhol Power plant in Maharashtra is currently a under cloud with its promoters involved in a legal battle with the state entity and its sole consumer for non-payment of bills. Policy makers and investors in the energy sector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of this key industry. Although private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating new capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health of the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power plant developers. After about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit only about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in greenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years. The factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection are almost inbuilt into the system. For one, there is a general agreement that stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution front has eroded the financial health of most SEBs. ``Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they are assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say. But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before they break even. The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron too says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry. IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it difficult for investors to take decisions. ``Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for eight projects, of which only three have taken off. Of this the Enron project is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source. According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs have registered a negative turnover. Which is why the financing or escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero. According to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results. But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that can help this backbencher.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit PossibleBy Himendra KumarOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES05/12/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu said. In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project.A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another meeting May 23. Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours. "I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes," Prabhu said. Earlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron Vice President John Ambler however, said, "While we have constantly maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract." The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9 billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs. A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel, recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated. Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer, failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each. -By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427; himendra.kumar@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. India: Talks begin on Dabhol issue05/12/2001Business Line (The Hindu)Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence WireMUMBAI, May 11. OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power Company. Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice.Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away. Instead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development Bank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting. When asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: "They are coming again on May 23. What does that mean?" Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details, senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the rebate slapped on DPC. "Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by DPC to the centre-stage," the official said. "The company has not mentioned a single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or the State. And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate in our letters to DPC," he said. Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the company would issue the preliminary termination notice. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their stand vis-a-vis Enron. They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project. They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is learnt. MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it against the non-performance penalty. Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice issued by DPC and made its position clear. The board is of the opinion that DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default. The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three arbitration notices served on it. It has said that since MSEB does not accept the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) - leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay. The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to the conciliation notice from DPC. Today's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC, Mr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and Mr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC. Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend. The next meeting is scheduled on May 23, Mr Lal said. Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr Harish Salve's candidature for the job. The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third conciliator is yet to be appointed. Dabhol Power Company had written to the Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process. DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators. Soon after the conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the project.

India to allow 3rd party sale if DPC, MSEB jointly approach05/12/2001Press Trust of India Limited(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) The Federal Government will allow sale of power to a "willing buyer" if the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will together approach the power ministry with a concrete proposal for their 2,184 mw project in Dabhol. "I will give whatever status they want, including a mega project one, if DPC and MSEB jointly approach the Centre (Federal Government) for the same", Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters here Saturday.He said the Indian Government would extend its cooperation to the Maharashtra government (western state) "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between MSEB and DPC. When pointed out that both the state government and DPC were of the opinion that federal power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should buy the power, Prabhu said NTPC cannot do so as it was power selling entity and not buying one. "There is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed by NTPC with the buying states", he reiterated. Prabhu said the Indian Government would also try and find out potential buyers of DPC power "if other states were willing to buy the same". Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 300-400 MW needed for the state from the 740 MW phase-I and soon to be commissioned phase-II of 1,444 MW, to other needy states.

LOCAL STORIESDEFAZIO CALLS FOR STATE TO BUY PGE TO PROTECT RATESDAVE HOGAN AND JEFF MAPES of the Oregonian Staff05/12/2001Portland OregonianSUNRISEC01(Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)Summary: The suggestion generates little enthusiasm and critics suspect it's motivated by the lawmaker's possible race for governor "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale markets." -- U.S. REP. PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.The state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market, U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday. Gov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but others said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing factors. Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else. Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon. "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore. PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month. Other possible buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp. While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea. "I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this time," said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. He said the state already has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and conservation. Senate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and talk with DeFazio. "I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't plan to devote much work to the proposal. Derfler questioned whether state government could run a utility as efficiently as a business. DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway corporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would provide some protection and stability in electricity rates. It also would be a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back into the state's coffers. The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state. DeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was "in the realm of possibility." DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE. Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to publicly owned utilities. However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity sales contracts that already are in place. And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks said. In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower. The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE, but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly owned utilities. He also said it seemed designed to get political attention for DeFazio's potential candidacy. "I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of those," Eachus said. DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with his plan.

BEGGSAssociated Press Writer05/11/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs. The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber, who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000 customers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets." DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and have the utility operate as a public power entity. He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources. "While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation. Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility. Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion, citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political environment in the West. Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private utility, as long as it would benefit consumers. DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville Power Administration's hydropower. The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature. "Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons. "Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said. "We have a bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue." Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating plants. Senate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job like a utility purchase.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they will not be able to block the move.Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. "In the first round, Indian lenders put their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice," said a source. The Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement said. SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for construction. Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 6,000 megawatts, are under construction. Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant benefits to end-users. New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia." In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a company official. Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business interest. Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power generation facilities, Enron says. Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(NGX), a wholly owned subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas Price Indices. NGX acquired the AECO "C" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, "We believe that inclusion of data from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that "more is better". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline system should improve the quality of our price indices even further." Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, "We are very pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices." The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be on a weighted-average basis. NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com.

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj05/15/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while UOG owns the remaining 51%. Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put up the money itself. Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf willoperate the upstream part of the project, which includes developingnatural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 2005. Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on the price of the pipeline. Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said. -By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714 331 4260; dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)2001-05-15 16:35 (New York)Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)     (Updates with closing share prices.)     Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sellPortland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can beinsulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.     ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control bykeeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,''U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield,Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.     The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, saidKitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.     Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader,agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, autility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra PacificResources of Reno, Nevada.     Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high powerprices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale'scollapse.     ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our assetportfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enronspokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer whorecognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined tocomment on a potential bid by Oregon.     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing pressreports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for PortlandGeneral.     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have morethan 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it addedPortland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns aboutmarket power,'' he said.                            Bond Issue     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, usingthe utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The statemight run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General salebecause of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators thatslow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants byutilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada powerplant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval ofthe Portland General purchase.     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border thisyear have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average Californiahomes for an hour.     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31percent this year.     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9pence to 492 ($7) in London.Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)     (Adds closing share price.)     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world'sbiggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricinginformation to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, aunit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't includetrades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculatinggas-price indexes.     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades incalculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enronspokesman Eric Thode said.     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnlineto sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of thecleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.     Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99.

meeting with : Mr. Shankman:In preparation for the meeting on December 12th with Larry Kellner, CFO, Continental Airlines, I have noted below some background on the Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  Mr. Shankman, please advise if you would like me to distribute this to the attendees.    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:Over the past several years Enron has been hedging Continental's crude oil.  The relationship has been beneficial to both sides.  As a result, since 1999 Enron has made over $9 million and Continental has saved over $45 million.  The purpose for the December 12th meeting is to address three initiatives in order of economic value:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.   Several new initiatives being proposed to Continental include the following:   exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (Craig Breslau, Originator)  transacting financial swaps on line (Larry Gagliardi, Originator)  creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (Mark Tawney and Gary Taylor, Originators)outsourcing Continental's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these products with Enron (Alan Engberg, Originator)Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:Ron Howard, Vice President, Food ServicesLarry Kellner, Chief Financial OfficerGreg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management CompanyJeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)Meeting Attendees from Enron:Jeff Shankman, President and COO, Enron Global MarketsJohn Nowlan, Vice President, Enron Global MarketsCraig Breslau, Vice President, Enron North AmericaMark Tawney, Director, Enron Global Markets (tentative) DISCUSSION: (Developed through conversations with Alan Engberg, Larry Gagliardi, Gary Taylor, Craig Breslau, Tracy Ramsey and Lucy Ortiz.)Enron Buy Side with Continental:Current Enron verifiable spend on Continental airline tickets was approximately $40 million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six months of 2000.  Enron Sell Side with Continental:(1) FUEL MANAGEMENT: Current Business:  Over the past 2 years, Craig Breslau and others have been managing a strong relationship with Greg Hartford, VP, Continental Fuel Management, hedging Continental's crude oil.  The first transaction was on January 14, 1998 -- a one month Forward on Kero.  Since then, Enron has completed 29 transactions with two commodities:  KERO and Crude.  Current business consists of three crude call options, settling in December 2000 ($31.00) and January, 2001 ($34.00 and $35.00)Value to Enron: Enron has earned $9,682,084 (1999-October 6, 2000)Value to Continental:  Continental has saved $45,001,744 (1999-October 6, 2000)Possible next steps:    (a) A transaction where Enron exchanges call options on crude oil for airline tickets.(b) Financial jet swaps on line:  Larry Gagliardi has already spoken with Rick Pressly, Director, Continental Fuel Management, regarding financial jet swaps on line.   At the time, Pressly was not interested in pursuing this product offering.  Value to Continental for (b):  a more perfect hedge as opposed to hedging with crude oil since hedging jet fuel with jet is a more perfect hedge.  Enron could offer services for the whole year and explore multi-year options as well both with financial and physical jet fuel.Possible next steps:  Would Larry Kellner be interested in (a) or (b)?  Enron could also supply Continental with jet fuel physical in the following locations such as the US Gulf Coast, New York harbor, the US West Coast, and Europe.  (Enron is doing this now with Delta airlines in New York harbor).  If so, Gagliardi could provide a guest password and Enron Online identification number if Kellner's office wanted to review the product.(2) WEATHER DERIVATIVE  PRODUCT:Business proposition:  Create a basket of weather related risks - such that aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment from Enron to Continental.Continental Airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in their annual reports and periodic press releases - particularly those discussing earnings.  It is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedge for all of Continental's weather related exposure.  However, it is not difficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it.  Continental has hubs in Houston, Newark, and Cleveland.  The weather conditions that create delays and increased costs in these areas include - rainfall above certain amounts, snowfall above certain amounts, temperatures below freezing (de-icing costs), winds above a certain speed, etc.  Value to us:  Create value by designing a basket of these risks.  Value to them:  Creation of a weather hedge to protect Continental's exposure.Possible next steps:   Upper management would need to issue a directive to various groups within Continental to describe what weather conditions affect the bottom line, how much they affect the bottom line, and then ask each group to attach a "confidence level" to each of their estimates - Continental could start a weather risk management program by only hedging a weighted average of their exposure x their confidence level - or some portion thereof.Exposure areas would be categorized according to the following:Clear exposure.  Quantifiable.Clear exposure.  Difficult to quantifyPotential exposure.  QuantifiablePotential exposure.  Difficult to quantifyFor each of the above categories, Enron would also need an indication of whether Continental has historical cost data against which we can regress historical weather data.Enron's weather derivatives team could then sit down with Kirk Rummel, Director and Airport Services Division Controller, and some of his team (or others designated by Kellner) and brainstorm about different types of weather that cause increased cost to Continental.  (Gary Taylor made a brief presentation to Rummel on November 6th; no follow up action with Enron has taken place to date)  (3)  PLASTICS:Business proposition:    Alan Engberg proposed that Continental outsource their antifreeze risk (ethylene glycol / propylene glycol) and plastics (high impact polystyrene, polyethylene) by hedging those products with Enron.Value to Continental: Cost/Budget certainty (assuming a perfect hedge whereby their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging) and associated reduction in volatility of cash flowsValue to Enron:  The value is approximately $2 million notional value if they hedged 100% of their 4 million pound polystyrene exposure.  Since Continental has not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy, Engberg cannot comment on the potential value to Enron though he is fairly certain it would be much larger than $2 million.Possible next stepsThis proposition is being considered by Ron Howard's team at Continental.  Continental needs to share their antifreeze spend with Enron.  Enron could then develop a proposal to Continental that includes perceived benefits of outsourcing their commodity risk to Enron.  Could a follow-up meeting with Ron Howard's team and Larry Kellner's designated contact be arranged to facilitate this process?Alan Engberg also recommends working with Continental on a strategic approach to modelling their overall exposures using VaR may prove extremely powerful and rewarding to both companies.  David Port is already (x-39823)  looking at ways to outsource Enron's expertise in this area.  Continental could be a pioneer in the effort.  Factors to model wouldinclude jet fuel, natural gas, electricity, currency, interest rates, plastics, antifreeze, paper, and, metal.

meetings on : Thad,Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual meetings?  We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in NJ.  Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week.  However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible alignments and opportunities.  This would include two primary areas:1)  EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use:  what types of potential solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and2)  EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the (common) markets served:  "sell with" (each other); and "sell through" (channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as sales channels for each other's sales forces.These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value propositions, such that they would have a "jumping off point" for a go-to-market effort (item #2, above).  In addition, the technical aspects of some of the "EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use" (item #1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be addressed.Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days synchronized with your executives'.

to meet : Adam:Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.  The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.  It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

Thank you for the dinner last night.I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people ina more relaxed setting. During out conversation yesterday, I was confusedabout a point you made. You stated that you spent most ofyour time on the phone with Traders in New York.  Whenyou talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towardsEnron Online, or are you doing trading outside of EnronOnline?  I think the underlying question that I am asking,is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader's job,or is it meant to bypass traders completely.Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forwardto talking with you again when you come to campus forinterviews.Cordially,Adam
meeting with : Meeting Minutes: Bristol Babcock, Pagosa Energy/Well Master, EBS, and GSSMeeting Purpose:  Business overview, solutions identification/brainstormingDate: 12/1/00EnronEBS Attendee:Anthony GilmoreGlobal Strategic Sourcing Attendee: Jeff YoungfleshBristol BabcockKevin FinnanJim GriffethPagosa Energy/Well MasterRob BenderDISCUSSION POINTS:1)  Bristol and Well Master feel that there is significant opportunity, with placement of enough BBI TeleFlow devices (integrated flow computer, corrector, recorder and controller/RTU) in North America that the data transmission needs would generate enough bandwidth demand that it would be of interest to EBS to provide some of its solutions to Bristol & Pagosa Energy "unified solutions" (quotes are mine - JKY) for the gas industry.  NOTE:  this could take a longer term to reach the necessary "critical status", due to the need for a very large hardware install base since each TeleFlow generates only about 11 - 12,000 bytes of data per day in its report bursts.1a)  In this scenario, the EBS opportunity would be primarily driven by sales of product solutions by BBI and Pagosa, which would include EBS network capacity.  (a "sell-through" effect for EBS)2)  There could also be enough demand for bandwidth- or related EBS solutions to Bristol by including Bristol's own internal I/T bandwidth consumption that a near-term solutions engagement would be desirable.  NOTE:  this could accelerate to the necessary "critical status", bringing to EBS more solutions demand due to the addition of "sell-to".  The "sell-through" effect would be present with Bristol/Pagosa selling solutions which use EBS' solutions (a sales "channel"), as well as EBS "sell-to" BBI & Pagosa for their own internal consumption of bandwidth.____________________________________________________________________ACTION ITEMS:  1)  Bristol will provide Anthony (Tony) Gilmore of Enron Broadband Services the necessary contact information for the appropriate people in FKI's (Bristol's parent co.) Info/Technology area.2) Enron GSS contacts (J Youngflesh) will attempt to ascertain if there would be value to Enron (GPG?) and/or its customers if they had the ability to execute nomination control all the way to the ground (upstream of gas well-head).3) EBS (Tony Gilmore) will begin working on the I/T discovery process, attempting to aggregate total Bandwidth demand: (usage patterns/volume/etc.) at Bristol and/or Pagosa.3a)  Per Rob Bender, Tony Gilmore should be contacting Al Freimeyer (sp?) at Pagosa to understand the volum of data from their daily batches from well-to-vendor.  Rob provided Tony Al's telephone number on 12/1.4)  Enron GSS to contact Ron Smith - waterSCADA.com - to investigate parallel opportunity (gas / water analog).5)  EBS and BBI/Pagosa will begin (internal efforts) to figure out ways of getting the TeleFlow CDPD data onto the EBS "Enron Intelligent Network"Next Meeting: TBDPlease let me know if I've missed anything.Thank you, JeffJeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716Bender Rob <rebende@earthlink.net>12/05/2000 08:50 AM  To: jeff.youngflesh@enron.com cc: Anthony_Gilmore@enron.net Subject: Meeting 12-1-00Dear Jeff:It was a pleasure meeting with you last Friday with Jim Griffith andKevin Finnan of Bristol Babcock.

meeting with : Steve/Chaz - I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of your attorneys.  Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten (PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract.  EBS may have some Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed materials (while being paid by Enron).  Eric is in the driver's seat with the contract at this point.  I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one form or another with BMC product and/or personnel.  In it, they have been requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles:  Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness of the BMC flexibility w/regard to "purchase commitment", etc.  In addition, I have re-iterated the time urgency.I have followed up the note w/telephone calls & messages to all of them:  Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.  I am meeting with Bob Martinez on Wednesday at 3pm.  Matson, Ogg, and Smith have me in their voicemailbox, Cummins was in a meeting and he said he would call me back.Would either one of you please let me know what BMC wants EBS to do for them:  how much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  Have I properly conveyed the "accepable-to-BMC method" of proving purchase commitment from Enron?  Your note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?I will call you to follow up on this note.Thank you,Jeff Youngflesh

City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron Corp. The water corporation, known as "the Hawk," voted 5-0 to grant the contract. If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant expansion for $32 million. But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds itself. The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could cost about $2 billion to implement. City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee this contract. The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. "In my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who will do it," Robinson said. The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council members to switch the contract to it. Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the Hawk procedures as well. John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman David Berg complaining of the "deleterious economic effect" on Azurix of the board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the job. Berg didn't do so. Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project Financial Times; May 15, 2001By ROBIN ALLENThere are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of "selling" at least part of its shareholding. The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. The project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a large-scale project, especially in the early stages. Dolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific North Field to Abu Dhabi. Qatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. "If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable" for western energy majors, asked one senior western diplomat, "then why are the serious US energy majors not involved?" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy Copyright: The Financial Times LimitedJAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). "If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per year," Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high electricity rates. A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the international market. Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating its market in 1998. These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. "The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California," Kean said. North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process he said held many benefits. Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts said at an industry seminar Tuesday. The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in March 2000.However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies. "What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly," said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the University of Tokyo. Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users. "There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization," Hatta said. He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered once the prices are liberalized. "If power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using electricity." Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. (ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries following the liberalization. Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called "Reassessing Power Deregulation," which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. Hatta of the University of Tokyo said "it's very wise" that Japan has begun the deregulation with the "bilateral supply, or trade" system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly. Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers, Hatta said. Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates - regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs are levied on prices. "There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices" nationwide, Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with "strong back-up" from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. "Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select independent power providers," Omuro said. -By Maki Aoto, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; maki.aoto@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.By Cameron Dueck05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and bankers say. But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity across Asia, they say. It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security offered by government payment guarantees. "Independant power producers (IPPs) will see Enron and Dabhol as an illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging market, but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be adversely affected because of it," said Philip Jackson, a banker with JP Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills. MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron. The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the $48.2 million outstanding. The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to MSEB if the dispute is not resolved. Local media reports earlier in May said Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital expenditure. Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or even changes in market conditions. But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient enough to back these agreements. Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they said. "Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're even more so," said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in Singapore. "If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad." Robert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy away from emerging Asian nations. "Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to call in a government guarantee," Booth said.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Saudi Won't Announce Winners Of Gas Projs Tue - Report05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported. The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers."Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with recommendations from the technical committee," the sources said, according to the newspaper. However, the oil council "might endorse some balances concerning the offers," the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further. Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas projects. Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas enhancement. After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and the oil companies in the past year, several companies were shortlisted for each project. The companies shortlisted for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development were Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E). For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were shortlisted. And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were shortlisted. -By Abdulla Fardan, Dow Jones Newswires; 973-530758; abdullah.fardan@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

MSEB refutes allegations by Enron, DPCGirish Kuber05/15/2001The Economic TimesCopyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)MUMBAI THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board on Monday in a letter to Enron refuted all allegations made against it by the company while invoking the political force majeure.Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on April 9 had invoked the political force majeure clause. DPC had indicated it was not in a position to fulfil its contractual obligations to MSEB because of political circumstances beyond its control. MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political circumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure. "Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related security documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our rights'," DPC had said. However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was uncalled for. For DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events occurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. MSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday. The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, which had been subjected to "concerted, deliberate and politically motivated actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform obligations under PPA". "Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that the political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for providing that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in protecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights," the statement added. However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs 402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply electricity as per the agreement. MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on Enron for not supplying electricity as per demand. MSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs 213 crore.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Saudi Supreme Petrol Council meeting to decide on huge gas project bids05/15/2001Business RecorderCopyright (C) 2001 Business Recorder; Source: World Reporter (TM)RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday. "The SPC has been discussing recommendations by the negotiating committee about the bids, and the meetings will continues executive president of the committee Abdulrahman al-Suhaibani told AFP. "It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final decision will be issued," added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon. The meetings began two weeks ago.A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. "The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early next week," the executive told AFP. The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, Conocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been shortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the executive said. Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic metres).-AFPCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

meeting with : After our meeting with Dell on 10/27, I sent a request to Charlie Ball (works for Kip) for detailed power data from TXU. Charlie delegated the task of getting this data to Randy Don Carlos, who has yet to return any of my calls to update the status of the request.Charlie Ball left me a message this morning indicating that Randy Don Carlos was leaving Dell at the end of the month. He indicated that he will get the information to me as soon as he can. I'm not sure, but it seems that no one has sent the request to TXU yet. TXU generally will send out data within 1-2 weeks of a request. It has now been 6 weeks since we asked Dell for the data. Assuming Charlie actually gets someone to send the data request to TXU, we should get something by the end of the year.Similarly, Continental has not yet sent over data that they were to request from HL&P. I talked with someone in Mark's group on 12/4, and she indicated that they had the data, but their real estate group wanted to review it before they sent it to us. On this one also, it is unlikely that any transaction will get done in this calendar year.Please call if you have any questions.
meeting with : Andy:Enjoyed meeting with you.  One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders.JohnAndrew Fairley02/20/2001 11:15 AMTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A Martin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Barry Tycholiz/NA/Enron@ENRON, Keith Holst/HOU/ECT@ectcc: David Gallagher/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Trip to HoustonThank you so much for your time last week.David and I found the time especially valuable.

meeting on : Mr. Nowlan:When we spoke several days ago, I had mentioned the meeting between Jeff Shankman and Larry Kellner, CFO, at Continental Airlines.  The meeting had been scheduled for December 11th, 2-3 PM in EB 3321.  I will know tomorrow if this date is confirmed.  Following our phone conversation, I did follow up with the persons you suggested -- Larry Gagliardi, Douglas Friedman and Mark Tawney -- as I completed an overview of our initiatives with Continental.The meeting on December 11th will enable Enron and Continental to continue discussions on three initiatives listed in order of economic value:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.  In order to verify attendees at this meeting, Jennifer Burns suggested that I follow up with you.  Please note the Continental attendees listed below.  Did you want to have the same origination team at the meeting or others?  I look forward to your response so I can coordinate with them and confirm their attendance.

to meet : the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.good holidays,johnslafontaine@globalp.com on 12/22/2000 07:11:26 AMTo: slafontaine@globalp.comcc:  Subject: Plants Shut Down and Sell the EnergySubject:  Plants Shut Down and Sell the EnergyPlants Shut Down and Sell the EnergyBy Peter BehrWashington Post Staff WriterThursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at itsgiant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from theBonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a betterdeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hittingunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It isselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what itpays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms inenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and evenoil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity ornatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such largeindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But theyalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminumand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt toconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said."The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't knowwhat they're going to use to grow crops with," said David Wyss, chiefeconomist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increasedtheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills onan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimatedthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for atypical U.S. household.That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higherenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expectedgrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annualrate in the first three months of next year. "Overall, the recent energyprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economicslowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., inSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which usenatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, thecompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production inDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under itsexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrativeofficer."We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, butRosenbury said it would be "substantial."  In coming months, Terra's goodfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and theprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-evenpoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminatethe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. "If this persists,"Rosenbury said, "it's going to be a real problem."He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operatingnow. "Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible thatfarmers will not have as much as they want," Rosenbury said. Royster-ClarkInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer anddistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning nextmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justifycontinued production. "We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able tobuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen," said PaulM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. Acontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production andraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions toplant feed corn, he said. "It's sticker shock."According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gasremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In thealuminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, theindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, ananalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,and December's production will be lower still, he said. "We'll get moreproduction cut announcements, I think," he said. A slowing in the U.S. andworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminumsupplies. "But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly morethan the current forecast," he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open questionhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractuallyentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonnevillefor $550 a megawatt hour for December.But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and futureprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund toBonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser andBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect afternext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveriesto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. "Outhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be anethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they liveup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power," Moseysaid., 2000 The Washington Post Company
to meet : Jennifer,I spoke w/Jenny Rub about almost every BMC/EBS issue, except for this one.  I did not know about the issue which Bruce Smith has sent (blue text, below) to Jenny and Bob McAuliffe.  When I spoke w/Jenny, I was unaware of BMC's retraction.  It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn't seem very "customer-focused" on BMC's part.  I certainly agree w/Bruce's statement to the effect that BMC needs to meet w/Philippe about their pricing!JKY
meeting with : Thanks, Chaz, for the response.  What I am looking for in question #3 (purchase commitment) is did I convey the info correctly re:  what BMC will accept from Enron to allow the EBS deal to close?  From notes to the Net Works directors and Bob McAuliffe, I have copied the following statements into the space below:  "1)  The pricing is applicable if EBS gets their deal done, and you are willing to provide some form of commitment (at least in writing, either e-mail or letterhead) to purchasing a BMC product in 2001...  For example, if Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their current testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail (or other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001 (the preference would be to get the "buy" done by end of 1st Qtr, if possible).  This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with their purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC."  Is this correct the way I have presented it to NetWorks?  Will their replies work for you if completed as requested above? I didn't want to put you in a bind when I told the NetWorks teams what BMC would feel is acceptable proof-of-commitment, nor did I want to have to go back to the Net Works group and change the requirements.I've got another note to send you in a minute or so, from Doug Cummins.Thank you,JeffChaz Vaughan@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS12/12/2000 07:29 PM To: Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON cc: Stephen Morse/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Subject: Re: BMC UpdateJeff,Thank you for your efforts on the BMC deal.

meeting on : Mr. Shankman:In preparation for the meeting on December 11th with Larry Kellner, CFO, Continental Airlines I have noted below some background on the Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  We would appreciate your answers to a couple of questions below.Background:Ron Howard, Vice President, Continental Food Services, met earlier this year with George Wasaff, Managing Director, Enron Corporation Global Strategic Sourcing and Tracy Ramsey, Sourcing Portfolio Leader,  to review the strong business relationship in fuel management and travel services which  Enron has had with Continental Airlines.  Discussions were held as to how this relationship could be expanded favorably for both companies.A subsequent meeting held October 25th enabled decision makers from both companies to act on these earlier discussions and explore opportunities to expand beyond the current fuel management and travel initiatives to those in weather derivatives and plastics hedging.December 11th Meeting Purpose:  Follow-up from October 25th meeting to specifically address Larry Kellner (who could not make the October 25th meeting) on three initiatives in order of $ magnitude:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.Location:  Larry Kellner's office will be getting back to us regarding his availability to do a quick tour of the trading floor.  If he can make it for a trading floor tour Kellner would meet at Enron Corporation; otherwise, he is requesting that Enron Executives meet in his executive offices at 1600 Smith Street.

meeting with : Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal.  Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.   From:  Russell Dyk @ ENRON                           10/23/2000 12:43 PMTo: Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging DealThe New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of. In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details. There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify. First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment would take place on February 15, 2000. Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue).  There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this transaction.CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end of this week. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.Regards,Russ

This book is a goodcandidate for a systematic review of the VaR process.It seems that the problem arises from forward - forward vols used by the VaR system. You can see in the attached spreadsheet that the VaR, on a cumulative basis,jumps on Jan 04, when an abnormal FF vol hits a relatively large position.This FF vol is also much different from the previous day number producing a bigjump in VaR.This row (Jan 04) is in magenta font in the attached spreadsheet. Please, lookat column D.The abnormal FF vol may result from one of the two factors: a. a bug in the code. We are working with the person in IT who wrote the                     code to review it. b. a poorly conditioned forward vol curve ( a kink or discontinuity in                    the fwd vol curve will do it). One solution I can propose, is to develop for                    the traders a fwd-fwd vol generator  allowing them to review the fwd vol curve                    before it is posted. If it produces a weird fwd-fwd vol,  it can be smoothed.Can you meet at 4 p.m. to review our findings?Vince

The idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis.

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals.

But the announcement, and the signing of memorandums of understanding early next month, will mark only the beginning of serious negotiations on terms for the three ventures, which together will need investment of some $25 billion. It will be months before final agreements are signed."We expect to have an agreement -- a final agreement -- signed somewhere at the end of the year, or, hopefully, the first quarter of next year," said Saudi Oil Minister Ali Naimi in an interview last week. Saudi Arabia's 11-member Supreme Petroleum Council is expected to meet today to endorse the companies recommended by a ministerial committee led by Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. In the following week, Saudi Arabia is expected to communicate its decision to the oil companies from both sides of the Atlantic that have been vying for a role in the three projects. By the end of the month, the chosen consortium members and Saudi officials are expected to agree on which three companies will lead the projects. This will be a prestigious role in a country that is the world's largest oil exporter, has more than a quarter of the world's oil reserves and has the fifth-largest reserves of natural gas. As with any negotiations for such huge projects, industry rumors abound. All three so-called oil supermajors -- Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group and BP PLC -- have been mentioned as project leaders, particularly for the plum Ghawar project, named after the world's largest onshore oil field, whose environs are expected to yield large volumes of gas. The Ghawar project, known as Core Venture 1, is projected to require about $15 billion in investment. Core Venture 2 is on the Red Sea coast. The third project is in Shaybah, a recently developed oil field in the kingdom's Empty Quarter, a southeastern region bordering the United Arab Emirates. The companies say they have no idea who will be named to the consortia, or who the Saudis will choose from a short list of 11 companies -- Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP, Chevron Corp., TotalFinaElf SA, ENI SpA, Enron Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Marathon Oil Canada Inc., Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Corp. -- to lead each project. But they all have their hopes. "We would be very disappointed if we are not the lead operator" for the Shaybah project, said Archie Dunham, Conoco's chairman and chief executive. Since Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah invited major oil companies to return to the kingdom in October 1998, negotiations have focused on such broad issues as the scope of the projects and their integrated nature -- from exploration and production of gas to the making of petrochemicals and electricity -- as well as the notion that the companies will need adequate returns on their investment. Soon, the project leaders will have to start the bargaining on such issues as the roles to be played by national champions Aramco and petrochemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corp. --- Alexei Barrionuevo in Houston contributed to this article. --- Population PressureSaudi Arabia is opening up its energy sector, in a bid to bolster the economy as population grows-- Population21.3 million (growing over 3.5% per year)-- Unemployment rate*27%-35% of males-- Real GDP Growth Rate7.6%-- Oil Production9.3 million barrels per day-- Natural-Gas Reserves204.5 trillion cubic feet-- Natural-Gas Production/Consumption1.68 trillion cubic feet*Unofficial estimate for 1999Note: Figures are estimates for 2000 except natural-gas production,which is for 1999Source: U.S. Energy Information AdministrationCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Cheney task force seeks input from interest groupsBy SHARON THEIMERAssociated Press Writer05/14/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House team developing a national energy plan has met with more than 130 interest groups, from environmentalists and unions often at odds with Republicans to major Bush supporters given private sessions with Vice President Dick Cheney. The vice president, Cabinet secretaries and others on a special task force have solicited ideas behind closed doors, hoping the privacy would encourage a free exchange of ideas.The White House has declined to provide names of participants - even to Congress. But interviews with participants detail a massive outreach where diverse interests have met with task force executive director Andrew Lundquist. Cheney's time has been reserved for meetings with more select participants such as power wholesaler Enron Corp. and the Edison Electric Institute, both GOP donors. Houston-based Enron is the world's top buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. "The way the task force is set up, they don't have the staff or time to have a huge host of companies come through the door. They have told us to work through our associations to the extent we can," said Don Duncan, vice president of government relations for Phillips Petroleum Co. Participants said the meetings, typically 20 minutes to 45 minutes, included about a dozen to 100 interest group members and a few task force members and staff. No details were disclosed. Instead, administration representatives summarized the nation's energy problems or listened as groups briefly offered background and proposals. Many sent detailed materials to the task force outlining their priorities. At a half-hour meeting in late March with White House strategist Karl Rove and Bush economic adviser Larry Lindsey, nuclear energy executives tried to make sure the two knew about the production records the industry has set over the past few years. At one point, Rove asked if anyone was looking to build a nuclear power plant. An executive with Exelon replied that his company was thinking about it, meeting participants said. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham has attended several meetings, including one with Teamsters President James Hoffa and an hourlong session in California with Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, who contends the administration has done little to help the power-strapped state. Like other governors, Davis was asked to provide one page on the state's power crisis, including a description of the problem, an anecdote about it and possible solutions. "They're asking for a one-page memo on possibly the biggest crisis ever affecting the state, with a massive ripple effect for the nation," Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said. "I think it demands more attention than a one-page memo." Cheney spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss said the task force has been studying the California problem almost daily. At a meeting between Abraham and about 100 coal industry representatives in late April, task force staffers handed out a briefing packet that outlined national energy needs, and then they listened to industry proposals. "I thought the purpose was one, to reassure people in the coal industry that coal was going to play a large role in the energy mix, and essentially when the plan is unveiled that they're going to be looking to people to help martial this through Congress," said Bill Banig, a lobbyist for the United Mineworkers Union. White House officials said the meetings are not designed to encourage lobbying and that task force members were carefully instructed on what was permissible under federal law. Cheney's meetings included Enron, Edison Electric Institute, California Republicans, and the senators from Nevada, home to the proposed Yucca Mountain federal nuclear waste site. The vice president plans to meet with the renewable-energy industry this week. Enron ranked among Bush's top 10 presidential campaign contributors, giving more than $110,000, and helped sponsor a $7 million party fund-raiser last month. The Edison Electric Institute gave Republican candidates more than two-thirds of its $193,000 in contributions last year. Edison International, whose holdings include the Southern California Edison electric utility, is also a major donor, giving $535,000 to Republicans last year and $330,000 to Democrats. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said Cheney met with Enron executives because the power wholesaler is a respected member of the industry, not because it was a contributor. Enron wants the administration's energy plan to ease electricity transmission bottlenecks, give companies incentives to invest in new transmission and make the wholesale power market as open as possible, he said. Tom Kuhn, the institute's president, said it is "totally ludicrous" to think political donations played a role. Cheney's meeting with Edison board members, held at the institute's invitation, lasted 15 minutes to 20 minutes. Cheney spoke about the task force process, Kuhn said. He said Cheney's remarks were consistent with the vice president's public statements. Edison wants to see new generation and transmission systems built, including coal, natural gas and nuclear and hydroelectric power, Kuhn said. Democrats in Congress sought a list of participants in the meetings, but Cheney's office responded by only listing broad categories and no names. That has left fodder for political attack. "You can't just take advice from one interest group or set of interest groups when you do these things," said Dave Albersworth of the Wilderness Society, whose group has met with Lundquist but was denied its request to talk with Cheney. Weiss countered that the energy task force has collected information from more than 130 groups since January in an "almost Herculean effort" to draw input from all sides. "People deserve the right to petition their government and not expect a full laundry list of who's called to be announced," she said. Enron spokesman Palmer said he is not seeking such privacy. "I'm happy to tell people what we're advocating for. I'd rather be talking about policy than about politics," he said. --- On the Net: White House Energy Task Force: http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud10.htmlCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

COMPANIES & FINANCE UK: Independents drill deep to strike rich seams: A new generation of smaller oil companies is emerging; a group that has discovered how to be competitive, writes David Buchan: Financial Times; May 14, 2001By DAVID BUCHANThe UK's listed small oil companies may have dwindled in number. But they can rightly say, echoing Mark Twain's words, that reports of their collective demise are exaggerated. Indeed, many in the UK-based exploration and production companies, dubbed "independents" in the sense of being untied to any refining and marketing, believe they have more of a role than when their kind first started operating in the North Sea 30 years ago. After the takeovers in recent years of Lasmo, Monument and British Borneo, there may only be about a dozen significant UK-based "independents" left. Yet they amount to virtually the entire European E&P sector: the only significant exception being Lundin Oil of Sweden. Many of the UK independents began life as local partners of US companies in the 1970s when the Labour government of the period gave preference to consortia with a local flavour. But this rationale disappeared when the Thatcher government took a more free-for-all approach to letting anyone develop the North Sea - though at the same time it did create the biggest UK independent by floating off British Gas' oil interests as Enterprise Oil. Enterprise is the only UK independent that is more than a niche or regional player. As such its E&P assets would be a significant addition to an oil major, hence the persistently rumoured interest in taking it over. As the North Sea became more competitive and difficult, some of the UK-based independents began to look elsewhere. "Unlike US independents which have always tended to be less interested in drilling outside North America, those in the UK have always tended to be more sympathetic to exotic parts of the world", says Mark Redway of Teather and Greenwood. Unfortunately, the obvious exotic new province that happened to open up in the early 1990s was the former Soviet Union. One company, Ramco Energy, dipped in and out very successfully, recently selling its 2 per cent stake in the Azerbaijan International Oil Consortium for Dollars 150m (Pounds 104.8m). Other UK independents - Aminex, Soco and Dana Petroleum - ventured into Russia and got stuck. While Aminex finds it hard to downplay Russia (because it has little elsewhere), Soco these days stresses its Mongolia and Vietnam operations. Another UK independent, JKX Oil & Gas, went into Ukraine, a country notorious for non-payment of energy bills. With diplomatic help from Tony Blair, the prime minister, JKX has just survived a legal attempt to rob it of its Ukraine assets. Two other independents have sunk more fruitful roots in Asia. "Cairn Energy now has as big a stake in Bangladesh's gas production as Shell, and it would be left, if Enron (the US energy company) were to quit India, as the biggest foreign player in India," says Iain Reid of UBS Warburg. Premier Oil is now a substantial Asian gas company, with production in Burma, Indonesia and Pakistan and long term contracts in Thailand and Singapore. But there are risks in these Asian ties. The obvious political one concerns Burma. Last year the UK government asked Premier to quit Burma because its presence was helping the military regime. Premier refused, and said it would carry on. The other risk, according to Mr Redway, is economic and it applies also to Cairn. Because there is no real world market for gas, Cairn and Premier are "very dependent on the strength of the local economies". But then, Mr Redway is an analyst who believes that independents' competitive edge lies in exploration rather than production. He therefore rates Fusion Oil & Gas highly as "the purest exploration investment opportunity in the E&P sector". Dana similarly vaunts its exploration expertise, but to a different end. Its goal, according to Tom Cross, chief executive, is to find oil and then swap exploration for production assets. "This avoids the expensive development stage of building platforms and pipelines and so on". Then at the other end of the spectrum are production-focused companies, such as Paladin, Tullow Oil or Venture Production. Roy Franklin, Paladin's chief executive, makes no bones about his company's scavenger strategy, spotting rich pickings overlooked by the majors. The majors are not always ready to sell, particularly recently when the oil price rise has widened the gap in price expectations between buyers and sellers. But Paladin was last year able to buy PetroCanada's assets in Norway, and is this year interested in bidding for some of what the Norwegian state is selling off. As its name suggests, Venture Production, a private Aberdeen-based company with North Sea and Trinidad operations, is focused on extraction, not exploration. And so are other private companies such as Intrepid, Consort Energy and Highland Energy, formed in the past three or four years. This new generation of company tends to be more cautious than the older one. "Exploration has probably been the best way to destroy shareholder value," says one executive. The other risk the new oilmen want to avoid is the vagaries of the stock market. "By focusing on production, the new companies are more predictable in terms of cash flow and earnings," says Mike Wagstaff, Venture's finance director.

QATAR: UAE's Dolphin may seek new partners if Enron exits.By Kedar Sharma05/14/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.DOHA, May 14 (Reuters) - Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL) may invite new foreign investors to join its project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates as U.S. Enron Corp looks set to bow out, industry sources said on Monday. "New partners are a possibility," Khaldoun al-Mubarak, project manager for DEL, majority owned by the UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), told Reuters."But at the moment we are in the midst of finalising the formal (development and production sharing) agreement with Qatar which should be done by September at the latest." Qatar and DEL in March signed a "commercial term sheet agreement" which outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited $3.5 billion project. UOG currently owns 51 percent of DEL, with the remainder held equally by France's TotalFinaElf and Enron. "Enron is going through major global restructuring," Mubarak said. "(But) they haven't officially notified us about their intention to pull out." Enron officials declined comment. Mubarak said interest in DEL was running high. "Everyone is asking for a stake," he said. The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet per day (cfd) of gas. UOG is to invest $2 billion in developing the North Field tract, drilling and setting up production facilities. The remaining $1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Ali and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi. First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or early 2005. About one billion to 1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would be consumed by utilities in Abu Dhabi with the remainder supplied to Dubai.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. UAE: UPDATE 1-Saudi expected to name gas race winners on Tuesday.By Peg Mackey05/14/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.DUBAI, May 14 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is expected to meet on Tuesday and announce the oil majors chosen for its multi-billion dollar gas investment opening, industry sources familiar with the negotiations said on Monday. The sources said the SPC is expected to name ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell as lead players in three so-called core projects involving the kingdom's upstream gas sector - off-limits to foreign oil firms since nationalisation in 1975.Signing of memoranda of understanding (MOUs) would most probably take place in early June, the sources said. The anticipated announcement would mark the biggest advance in the kingdom's gas initiative, valued at an initial $25 billion, since Riyadh unveiled its energy investment opening over two years ago. But the hard work has yet to start on the opening of Saudi Arabia's gas sector, the world's fourth biggest. "The fiscal regime and regulatory details have not been developed," said one source. FINAL CUT Riyadh is expected to trim back its original shortlist of 11 potential foreign investors revealed last summer. Those companies had been grouped under three core venture consortia - South Ghawar, Red Sea and Shaybah. For ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell, securing the lead role in Saudi Arabia's core ventures would entitle them to operate the package and get the biggest slice of the projects, analysts said. Other industry sources said ExxonMobil, the world's biggest energy company, was tipped for the top slot in core venture 1 (South Ghawar) as well as in core venture 2 (Red Sea). Royal Dutch/Shell was in pole position for core venture 3 (Shaybah), the sources added. Both oil supermajors already have significant foreign investment in the kingdom and feature as top customers of Saudi oil, the analysts said. ENERGY DRIVERS An urgent need to create jobs and grow the economy are driving Saudi Arabia's landmark energy opening. And analysts said big oil companies were prepared to help the kingdom achieve those aims even if the return on their investment was relatively low. "Major oil companies just cannot miss this opportunity," a source said. "The gas projects will show profits." But just how much revenue oil companies will generate by selling water and electricity in the Saudi domestic market remains to be seen. On paper, at least, the kingdom's domestic gas sector looks set for impressive growth. Domestic gas demand, now running at about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day, is forecast to grow at more than seven percent a year over the coming decade. Saudi Arabia has meanwhile made clear that its prized oil sector, the world's biggest, remains off limits. Even so, oil companies still hold out hope for eventual involvement in oil, the kingdom's lifeblood. "The companies are just as happy with gas, but oil remains the ultimate objective," a regional analyst said. "Saudi Aramco is still putting up strong defence barriers, but eventually they could open up the oil sector once they feel comfortable working with the majors." The Saudi gas initiative seeks foreign oil companies' help in developing the kingdom's known gas reserves as well as investment in downstream projects fed by gas supplies, such as power and desalination. The following companies have been shortlisted for the gas projects: Core venture 1 (South Ghawar Area) - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP , TotalFinaElf , Chevron and ENI . Core venture 2 (Red Sea Area) - TotalFinaElf, ExxonMobil, Marathon , Enron/Oxy , Conoco , Royal Dutch/Shell. Core venture 3 (Shaybah Area) - Royal Dutch/Shell, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Conoco, TotalFinaElf, Phillips and Enron/Oxy.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Saudi Oil Council To Meet Tue On Gas Projects -Sources05/14/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- International oil companies vying for a stake in Saudi Arabia's downstream gas projects, expect to be notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate, industry sources in the kingdom said Monday. Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council is set to meet Tuesday and shortly after, announce its final selection for each of the three core ventures on offer, the sources said.The Saudi Arabian committee negotiating with international oil companies on the Gas Initiative, submitted its proposals for consortium members and leaders to the country's Ministerial Council in April. These were then passed on to the SPC for final approval. Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Abdullah, who heads the SPC, is in Bahrain Monday attending a Gulf Cooperation Council leaders' summit along with Saudi Arabia's foreign minister, Saud Al Faisal, who heads the gas negotiating committee. Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas enhancement. After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and IOC's in the past year, the following companies were shortlisted for each project. Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E) for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development. For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were listed. And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were listed. With all those shortlisted expected to play some role, the immediate and essential question for each of the IOC's is whether they will be selected to lead and operate a project, with Core Venture 1 the most sought after, industry sources said. Exxon Mobil and Shell have been tipped as frontrunners for this venture. The operator's role will be more crucial than ever here as it will be responsible for directing further negotiations on the projects at hand which will lead to final deals probably by year end. Also, operators are expected to decide and direct how the project's individual and large components will be developed, details the Saudis haven't finalized, sources said. The three ventures have been estimated at a combined value of about $25 billion. -By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714-331-4260; dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BusinessRFID chip will help speed up business05/14/2001The New Straits TimesMain/Lifestyle; 2*26(Copyright 2001)THE combination of recently developed "stick-on" Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip technology with a global positioning system (GSP) will transform and quicken the pace of doing business in the oil and gas industry. And Malaysia must adapt to this shift to maintain her global positioning.Global management and technology consultant Global Energy Strategy Practice which is working in partnership with Accenture Sdn Bhd wants to promote this idea locally. Global Energy Strategy Practice partner Paul Spence said that applying this latest combined technology, car owners can fill up a petrol tank without resorting to human contact or to the use of a credit card. Relevant personal data embedded in the RFID chip would be machine read and the required quantity of petrol delivered, as if right out of a science fiction movie. This surreal development is made possible through the application of ubiquitous-commerce (u-commerce) whereby computers and machines communicate with each other to affect an impression of an omnipresent intelligence. Such technology is economically available today. "There are technology suppliers who are offering these capabilities." The technology also has applications outside the oil and gas industry. Communications between machines can now allow or deny access of individuals to restricted zones. In an interview in Petaling Jaya recently, Spence said: "A lot of my clients now are asking, whether that same technology can be used to restrict access into hazardous areas, plants or production sites. "Can a warning alarm be fitted to the individual or to an assistant? There are lots of safety, health and environment applications around that." "Guru in the field" is another potential application where a combination of RFID chips, video cameras, personal digital assistants (PDA) and personal computers can deliver distant technical advice on- site. "An industry client operating in the North Sea oil fields has a prototype mounted on a workman's helmet which sends snap-shots to experts on the other side of the world. "The effect of this new combined technology on global financial and commodity markets is to lock them in tighter correlation. "The days of being able to arbitrage for profits between geographical markets are shortening within the energy industry. Enron which is the biggest oil trader in the US is now hedging on weather derivatives." Accenture partner Lim Beng Choon said that to compete globally, the oil and gas industry in Malaysia would have to implement this new technology to remain connected to global markets.Caption: Lim ... connected.

India: Godbole panel report may suggest MSEB bifurcation05/14/2001Business Line (The Hindu)Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence WireMUMBAI, May 13. THE second part of the Dr Madhav Godbole committee report is expected to be submitted to the State Government on May 15. While the first part of the report recommended renegotiation of the power purchase agreement with Enron's Dabhol Power Company, the second part is expected to suggest bifurcation of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, sources said. The committee, which has been given the mandate to negotiate with Enron officials to make DPC power more acceptable, had a marathon meeting on May 11 to finalise the second half of the report."The committee has been considering the bifurcation of MSEB," a source said. "The idea is to try and separate the distribution from generation and transmission." While generation and transmission can be controlled by the State, there may be a suggestion to privatise the distribution arm. Over 1.5 lakh MSEB employees had gone on a strike to oppose a Bill to unbundle the board into three divisions - generation, transmission and distribution - due to fear of privatisation. MSEB, the State's leading power company, has been facing huge losses due to delay in payments and theft of power. The second part of the report is expected to address the problem in detail. Part one of the report submitted on April 10 had said: "...none of the solutions espoused for independent power producers, in general, and DPC, in particular, is tenable without the reforms of MSEB, especially its distribution business, which it shall address in part II of the report." The report is expected to "suggest appropriate measures to ensure that the interests of the State, MSEB and electricity consumers of the State of Maharashtra are properly and adequately considered, evaluated and safeguarded," according to the terms of reference laid down when forming the committee. The committee originally consisted of Dr Madhav Godbole, Mr Deepak Parekh, Dr E.A.S. Sarma, Dr Rajendra Pachauri and the State Energy Secretary, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal. The MSEB Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, has been inducted as part of the panel after the submission of the first part and before the beginning of negotiations with Enron.

The Smart InvestorTertiary will be primaryIndira Vergis05/14/2001Business Standard2Copyright (c) Business StandardThese are volatile times for world business. There are increasing jitters that a slowing US economy could dampen prospects for the global economies. Many developing regions, especially in Asia, are bracing themselves for a bout of slightly lower growth. But two countries, India and China which together account for about half the region's gross domestic product (GDP_ will still continue to see their GDP grow at six per cent, forecasts the Asian Development Bank.Many Indian economists agree with ADB's projections. In fact, they view the prediction of a six per cent growth in India's GDP as benign. Nearly 54 per cent of India's GDP is delivered by its services sector and a modest performance by this sector, some economists say, will be enough to hold up the GDP at six per cent. There are others who hope that better agricultural performance could prompt the economy to hand in a better scorecard. However, the Indian industry remains trapped in the doldrums, suffering from a lack of consumer confidence and investments. Very few economists expect to see signs of recovery sprouting any time soon. An interest rate cut is considered vital by many to energise the sector. And, they argue, there are certain economic indicators that encourage such a move. Inflation is running at very low levels and the nation's foreign exchange reserves are currently high enough to provide a strong defence to the Indian currency. Surprisingly, our trade balance, which threatened to spiral out of control by surging oil prices last year, has been contained. Since then, oil prices have retreated and are expected to remain subdued. While a rate cut may go some way in reviving sentiment and activity in the industrial sector, stirring up consumer demand will still hinge on a normal monsoon. Rain, rain, come again For many economists, the prediction of India clinging to its current GDP level is heavily contingent on a normal spell of monsoon this year. "According to our assessment, we believe the Indian economy will grow by around 6.5 per cent this fiscal year," says Chetan Ahya, vice president at J M Morgan Stanley Securities. In 2000-01, agricultural growth withered under a poor monsoon and a subsequent drought in many parts of the country. For the second year in a row, growth in the sector sank below one per cent. It stood at 0.9 per cent compared with 0.7 per cent the previous year. While agriculture accounts for only 24 per cent of GDP, it remains the most keenly-watched sector by economists. "The performance of the agricultural sector is important because of its linkages to the economy both on the supply side and on the consumption side," says Mohan Nagarajan, chief economist at Credit Analysis and Research Ltd (CARE). "It would lead to a better performance of agro-based industries," he adds. More significantly, roughly 60 per cent of Indians still depend on agriculture for their livelihood. "A good crop means that demand for everything, from everyday use goods like toothpaste to larger items like tractors will pick up," says Nagarajan. Economists are hoping that a good monsoon will budge growth in the sector to around 1.5 to 2.5 per cent. In service of the economy Another key sector economists will be watching out for will be services. India's services sector ranging from finance, insurance, hospitality to transportation and communication slowed its pace in 2000-01. With growth weakening by a whole per cent to 8.4 in 2000-01, sluggishness in this important sector has been blamed for dragging down the overall GDP. Most economists expect the sector to post either relatively flat growth or edge slightly higher this year. But, it's performance will be vital to ensure that overall GDP holds at six per cent. "Even if the agriculture and industry numbers fall again but services sees even seven to eight per cent growth, it will be enough to keep the GDP around six per cent," says Nagarajan. Construction activity a services component that includes housing, roads and other infrastructure projects demonstrated surprisingly good growth of 8.7 per cent and is expected to maintain the pace. Road construction is tipped to show increasing levels of activity as work on the ambitious highway linking Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai and Calcutta intensifies. Chiming in will be the housing industry, benefiting in recent years from tax reliefs and attractive financing schemes, and which have encouraged more people to buy houses. Another segment slated to witness good growth will be IT-enabled services, says Morgan Stanley's Ahya. "We are emerging as the services workshop of the world," he says. IT-enabled services like call centres and data processing, though currently generating tiny revenues, are slated to turn into big money spinners in the years ahead. The telecommunications industry will also see improving levels of investment. "The penetration of services is so low, that it has an intrinsic high growth rate," says Ahya. For a taste of the market, consider this: out of the 100 Indians, only one uses the Internet and less than three own a telephone. A good home show And there could be a pleasant surprise in store for industry amid all the gloom over its performance. Adequate liquidity conditions are spurring expectations of a cut in interest rates. Broad money(M3) a gauge of total money available in the economy increased 16.2 per cent in 2000-01 against 14.6 per cent last year. While the Reserve Bank of India had cut the bank rate in March, the belief is that a further cut of 50 basis points is imminent. The bank rate the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks currently stands at seven per cent. Aiding the cause is the inflation data which shows the wholesale price index at a tame 5.84 per cent. With economists betting that oil prices will remain in the $24-28 a barrel range, inflation is not expected to exhibit the oil price-inspired gyrations of last year. A cut could coax the industry to step up activity, though admittedly, much would still depend on rural demand. Neighbours' envy And while many Asian countries watch with increasing nervousness the impact of an American downturn on their economies, India and China can afford to remain relatively placid about global developments. That's because they are less dependent on the US for their own economic health. That is expected to shield them somewhat from being blown off-course like some other Asian nations by the ill-wind of an American slump in demand. With exports making up less than 10 per cent of India's GDP, its economy is clearly not export-driven. In contrast, nearly 35 per cent of Indonesia's GDP comes from exports, 57 per cent for Thailand, and 50 per cent for the Philippines. Yet, despite claiming only a small percentage of GDP, India's exports remained a bright spot amid some gloomy economic data. Exports raced ahead 20 per cent to $44.1 billion in 2000-01. It was the second consecutive year of good exports growth. On the flip side, imports rose, too, during the same period to Rs $49.1 billion. But non-oil imports, however, declined 15 per cent to $34.2 billion. That helped narrow the trade gap to $5.74 billion from $12.79 billion the previous year. Still, India can ill-afford to ignore completely the risks of an American slump in demand. The US is India's largest trading partner and, in 2000-01, a quarter of its exports headed to that nation. Besides, by taking in nearly 70 per cent of India's software exports, it is also India's most important software exports destination. Booming software exports accompanied by remittances by Indians living overseas have been the primary factors exerting a calming influence on India's balance of payments of position, especially in times of economic turbulence. For example, last year, while a surging oil import bill threatened to rattle the nation's trade gap, inflows from invisibles(including income from software and Indians living abroad) came to the rescue helping India limit its overall current account deficit. It's a sobering realisation that has compelled the National Association of Software and Service Companies(NASSCOM) to lower its exports forecast to between $8.5 billion to $9 billion from its previous figure of $9.5 billion. Earlier, it had also revised estimates for 2000-01 lower to $6.2 billion from $6.3 billion. Still, observers say it isn't a cause for depression. "They are still talking about growth. It is a decline in the growth rate and not an actual downturn itself," points out John Band, chief executive officer, ASK-Raymond James and Associates. And remittances look set to maintain their pace as well. "Most remittances are still from Indians who live in the Middle East, and I don't see any slowdown from this segment," says CARE's Nagarajan. Remittances totalled $9.8 billion in the nine months to December 2000. Software exports brought in $4.6 billion during the same period. Foreign institutions support Another recent 'feel-good' sign has been evident in the stock markets too. Between January and April 2001, eigners poured in Rs 7,368 crore into India's equity markets - a phenomenal 15 per cent more than what they invested in the whole of calendar 2000. Yet, experts aren't reading too much into it. In the past few months, investors have been fleeing from a shower of profit warnings in the US and seeking cover in alternative investments. As they rejuggle their portfolios, some money will inevitably flow into India and other countries, experts say. Because it isn't affected so much by what's happening externally, they see India as some kind of a safe haven," says ASK's Band. Yet some hesitation Recently, gunning for more foreign direct investments (FDI), the government opened more sectors for foreign and private participation, including pharmaceuticals, hotels, banking and astonishingly, even defence. However, tempting FDI has always been a vexing issue for India. In 2000-01, FDI did improve slightly, moving 26 per cent higher than the previous year to $2.4 billion. Yet, China a market India is frequently compared with in terms of size and potential attracted 20 times more FDI in the same period. Economists now shrug off FDI as a tool to kick-start investment in the country. "It's a pittance and it probably will remain stagnant," says an economist at a foreign research house. The reasons are not hard to find. Foreigners seeking to invest in India have many fences to cross. Frequent changes in sector policies, chaotic infrastructure facilities and nightmarish bureaucratic redtape have often left foreigners tired and wary of doing business in India. The stress of investing in India is most clearly visible in the recurring concerns that have stubbornly dogged US energy giant Enron's 2,148 MW power project in Dabhol in Maharashtra. After being forced to renegotiate a power supply deal in 1995 after concluding it in 1992, Enron has hit the headlines once again. This time, an almost bankrupt state electricity board (SEB) refuses to pay its dues for power received and the state government refuses to honour its commitment to pay in case the SEB defaults.It's led to intense speculation that, after suffering repeated snags for nearly a decade, Enron might simply pull out of the project altogether. A disturbing turn of events, since, till recently, Enron Corp was the biggest foreign investor in India. It will not be the first time that exasperation will have egged on a foreign investor to pull out of a project. Earlier, US-based Cogentrix Energy had also walked out of its $1.5 billion 1,000 MW Mangalore power project citing endless bureaucratic hurdles. And there has also been some disappointment over India's much-hyped 300 million middle class which was supposed to be growing rapidly. Many international firms, inspired by this figure, had scrambled to set up operations to conquer a huge chunk of this market. Now many are struggling to break even and still learning to adapt to local tastes a key ingredient for success. That's why despite all its attempts to open up various sectors, India still remains a tough sell. Outlook With a little help from the rains, India could notch up a growth rate of six per cent. Many economists have also pointed out that a reforms-studded budget could also inject some enthusiasm in the patient that is the economy. Strong measures include plans to reform labour laws and government employment. These are expected to boost the economy's development, though in the long run. The recent opening up of various sectors could also revive sentiment, although whether this will translate into FDI flows is arguable. Still, every bit helps. The fact remains that it will have to persist in trying to accelerate the pace of growth if its ambitions of turning into an economic powerhouse are to be realised. After all, for the second most populous nation in the world with one of the biggest markets, its economic power is still nowhere near the figure its size suggests.Acegas shares, potential for growth (Acegas, le potenzialita di crescita del titolo)05/14/2001La Repubblica41Copyright (C) 2001 Abstracted from La Repubblica in Italian; Source: World Reporter (TM)Italian brokers Rasfin SIM have indicated the potential for growth in the shares of Acegas, the former municipal utility of the Italian city of Trieste. Acegas closed the first quarter of this year with turnover of L137bn (+45 per cent). Results attributed in part to the start of production of Estenergy, a consortium of the utilities of Udine, Trieste, Gorizia and Enron of the US, which supplies energy and services to parts of Friuli. Also significant, according to Rasfin, were investments over the period, which totalled L43bn.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. A SectionIN THE LOOP Al KamenRoundabout to the Oval OfficeAl Kamen05/14/2001The Washington PostFINALA19Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights ReservedSometimes even Cabinet officers can lose their way in the White House. So there was Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson, clearly lost Friday at a fork in a corridor near White House spokesman Ari Fleischer's office. "How do you get to the Oval Office?" he asked a group of reporters and was directed to the right door, according to a wire report.Fleischer, though, told reporters that was the wrong answer. "How do you get to the Oval Office? First you win the Iowa caucus, then you lose the New Hampshire primary, then you make a comeback in South Carolina," he quipped as he recalled President Bush's early primary campaign last year. Passport, Please Meanwhile, folks at Thompson's HHS may be taking to calling him "Tightwad Tommy." Seems a memo went out March 15 undermining Alaska and Hawaii's claims to be part of the United States. Employees "must clear . . . international travel" with the office of the deputy chief of staff for operations, said the memo from the deputy chief, Ed Sontag. To clarify, "HHS employees seeking to travel outside the continental U.S." for meetings and conferences, must get permission and then file trip reports within two weeks. This sent officials calling around, asking whether trips to those states were to go through the international travel approval system just as if they were going to Russia or the Congo. Apparently so. The edict would appear to include even the nearby Virgin Islands and practically next-door Puerto Rico as well. Loop Fans can only hope this outrage doesn't spread to other agencies. It would make for some cold winters. Chewing Out on the Bush Beat Speaking of Fleischer, the usually affable spokesman is not reluctant to get tough with reporters when he believes they've stepped out of line. Sheriff Fleischer was on duty Thursday and upset with Houston Chronicle reporter Bennett Roth. Bush that morning urged parents to talk more to their kids about the dangers of drugs. Roth, at Fleischer's daily briefing, asked: "Ari, the president talked about parental involvement today. How much has he talked to his own daughters about both drugs and drinking? And given the fact that his own daughter was cited for underage drinking, isn't that a sign that there's only so much effect that a parent can have on their children's behavior?" Fleischer responded brusquely: "No, I think, frankly, there are some issues where I think it's very important for you all in the press corps to recognize that he is the president of the United States; he's also a father. And the press corps has been very respectful in the past of treating family matters with privacy, and I'm certain that you're going to do so again. I hope so." Fleischer later called Roth to chastise him, telling him his question had been "noted in the building." Competing to Oversee the Corps Former Mississippi representative Mike Parker, a Democrat-turned-Republican who lost a gubernatorial bid a couple of years back, had been seen as the pick to be assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, overseeing the Army Corps of Engineers. Parker, a former undertaker, had support from the barge industry, the various corps constituencies and fellow Mississippian Trent Lott, the majority leader of the Senate. But the Pentagon's choice was Lawrence Izzo, recently retired president of Enron Engineering and Construction Co. who has been in the mix for several jobs. Izzo, a West Point grad, had 23 years at the Corps before going to Enron, former home of Army secretary-designate Thomas White. The majority leader was said to be most unhappy. The latest word is Parker's getting the job. Ex-Reporters Move On Kenneth J. Klein, a former reporter who has worked for 17 years for Florida Sen. Bob Graham (D), most recently as chief of staff, is joining the Outdoor Advertising Association of America as executive vice president for government relations. Former Washington Post colleague Thomas W. Lippman, a 33-year national, foreign and financial reporter and author who became vice president of communications at the World Wildlife Fund in 1999, is moving next month to be managing director at communications consulting firm Chlopak, Leonard, Schechter & Associates.

Largest LNG 13 Conference Opens Today05/14/2001Korea TimesCopyright (C) 2001 Korea Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)The largest-ever International Conference and Exhibition on liquefied natural gas (LNG 13) opens today for a four-day run at the Convention and Exhibition Center (COEX) in southern Seoul. A total of 125 companies and organizations represented by 2,500 delegates and exhibitors from 50-odd countries, including Japan, the United States, Britain and Australia, are participating in the international event, co- organized by the Korea Gas Union and the Korea Gas Corp. (KOGAS).Commerce, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Che-shik will be delivering congratulatory remarks on behalf of Prime Minister Lee Han-dong who is currently on an official trip to the Middle East. There will be a visual presentation from Lee during the opening ceremony. ``We have spent more than a year preparing for this international event which is the largest in terms of the number of participants and exhibitors,'' said Lee Seung-hwan, chairman of the Korean National Organizing Committee. LNG 13 is 15 percent larger than the conference and exhibition held in Australia back in 1998 which reflects the growth of the industry, Lee explained, adding that the demand for LNG has been increasing rapidly here in Korea. A wide range of topics will be presented during the four days of conferences and exhibitions, helping to showcase the importance of the LNG industry. Among the numerous papers to be presented at the triennial event are ``Old World, New World, Tomorrow's World: How LNG Has Changed Since LNG 12'' and ``The Next Generation of LNG Plants.'' ``Hosting this meaningful event in Korea will help elevate Korea's image in the international market, particularly with the sheer scale and size of LNG 13,'' said Kim Myung-kyu, president and CEO of KOGAS and chairman of the Korea gas Union. The conference will include paper sessions, workshops, poster sessions and film presentations while exhibitors will demonstrate their exclusive technologies for the exploration and production of LNG as well as plant construction. The official sponsors of LNG 13 are the International Gas Union, the Gas Technology Institute and the International institute of Refrigeration while the major sponsors are Shell Gas and Power, KOGAS, LG-Caltex, SK-Enron, the Qatari Group, TotalFinaElf, British Petroleum and Exxon Mobile. In addition to the conference and exhibition, there will be a technical visit to the Inchon LNG Receiving Terminal in Inchon, about 50 kilometers west of Seoul, on Friday.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

to meet : Jennifer,I had forgotten to invite Roy, but I did tell him about the meeting, and he was OK w/getting the notes after the fact.  I also told him I would not forget to keep him in the loop and invited to any future meetings.As for Ron Smith, I really have egg on my face.  I totally forgot about Ron (I was thinking only Instromet, and S-J was running with that).  I think that in my excitement and effort to get this meeting put together, I overlooked a few important details.  I will certainly do a better job next time!Thanks for the reminder!JYp.s. I was unable to get w/George during the day yesterday, but I did catch him at about 6:35pm.  I gave him my update on the latest BMC/EBS activities (Crowder is going to meet w/Philippe today).  He gave me some good feedback, and I think that for the most part, I'm on the right track.  The only thing I've done which I feel could provide (potential) negative exposure, based on feedback from George; is discussing w/BMC the idea that perhaps EBS could do the buy/take $1MM, and pay/keep credit of $2MM...I wasn't admonished, but KGW felt that I would have been better off not discussing that w/BMC...You and I can talk, though, because I'm not so sure that it was a bad thing, in this case.  But next time, there won't be a next time - so that won't be an issue anyway!Jennifer Medcalf@ECT12/07/2000 08:45 AM To: Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON cc:  Subject: Re: Bristol Babcock/Pagosa Energy - Well Master/Enron meeting notesJeff,The meeting minutes look great and that it was a very beneficial meeting for all parties.

meeting on : All,In our meeting on the 17th of November, the NetWorks team explained their position(s) relative to possible upcoming purchases of software, in which BMC might be selected as the vendor.  There were several issues and concerns which were voiced, mostly related to BMC's lack of support and suboptimal application capability (that is the "net", understated version).Bob, you and I spoke briefly after the meeting regarding what, if anything, BMC could do to "fix their problem".  I relayed the gist of our brief conversation to EBS.As discussed in the meeting, EBS has a near-term opportunity to get a deal done with BMC, and it would be of optimum benefit to execute this year.  One of the outcomes of our November 17 meeting is that EBS has been pressing BMC for a BMC commitment to Enron's overall customer satisfaction.  Per a voicemail to me from EBS, it appears that BMC have provided a response to EBS.I would like to schedule a meeting for the addressees of this note for either November 30th, or December 1st.  The purpose is to get an update from the NetWorks team on the BMC application testing that was underway, and for EBS to explain what BMC has proposed.  This meeting should take an hour.  Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow or Friday.

meeting on : Mr. Shankman:In preparation for the meeting on December 11th with Larry Kellner, CFO, Continental Airlines I have noted below some background on the Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  We would appreciate your answers to a couple of questions below.Background:Ron Howard, Vice President, Continental Food Services, met earlier this year with George Wasaff, Managing Director, Enron Corporation Global Strategic Sourcing and Tracy Ramsey, Sourcing Portfolio Leader,  to review the strong business relationship in fuel management and travel services which  Enron has had with Continental Airlines.  Discussions were held as to how this relationship could be expanded favorably for both companies.A subsequent meeting held October 25th enabled decision makers from both companies to act on these earlier discussions and explore opportunities to expand beyond the current fuel management and travel initiatives to those in weather derivatives and plastics hedging.December 11th Meeting Purpose:  Follow-up from October 25th meeting to specifically address Larry Kellner (who could not make the October 25th meeting) on three initiatives in order of $ magnitude:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.Location:  Larry Kellner's office will be getting back to us regarding his availability to do a quick tour of the trading floor.  If he can make it for a trading floor tour Kellner would meet at Enron Corporation; otherwise, he is requesting that Enron Executives meet in his executive offices at 1600 Smith Street.  Is either location fine for you or do you have a specific preference?Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:Ron Howard, Vice President, Food ServicesLarry Kellner, Chief Financial OfficerGreg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management CompanyJeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)Mr. Shankman, who would you like to have at the meeting from Enron? To date, we have coordinated through John Nowlan.  At the October 25th meeting,  Alan Engberg and Mark Tawney presented the plastics hedging and weather derivatives opportunities, respectively.  Next week, I will be forwarding a short briefing which outlines  Enron's current relationship with Continental in fuel management and the proposed initiatives in both weather derivatives and plastics hedging.  Larry Gagliardi, Craig Breslau, Alan Engberg, and Gary Taylor are all providing input on this.Sarah-Joy HunterEnron CorporationGlobal Strategic Sourcing -- Business Development#(713)-345-6541
meeting with : Mr. Shankman:In preparation for the meeting on December 12th with Larry Kellner, CFO, Continental Airlines, I have noted below some background on the Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  Mr. Shankman, please advise if you would like me to distribute this to the attendees.    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:Over the past several years Enron has been hedging Continental's crude oil.  The relationship has been beneficial to both sides.  As a result, since 1999 Enron has made over $9 million and Continental has saved over $45 million.  The purpose for the December 12th meeting is to address three initiatives in order of economic value:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.   Several new initiatives being proposed to Continental include the following:   exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (Craig Breslau, Originator)  transacting financial swaps on line (Larry Gagliardi, Originator)  creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (Mark Tawney and Gary Taylor, Originators)outsourcing Continental's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these products with Enron (Alan Engberg, Originator)Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:Ron Howard, Vice President, Food ServicesLarry Kellner, Chief Financial OfficerGreg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management CompanyJeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)Meeting Attendees from Enron:Jeff Shankman, President and COO, Enron Global MarketsJohn Nowlan, Vice President, Enron Global MarketsCraig Breslau, Vice President, Enron North AmericaMark Tawney, Director, Enron Global Markets (tentative) DISCUSSION: (Developed through conversations with Alan Engberg, Larry Gagliardi, Gary Taylor, Craig Breslau, Tracy Ramsey and Lucy Ortiz.)Enron Buy Side with Continental:Current Enron verifiable spend on Continental airline tickets was approximately $40 million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six months of 2000.  Enron Sell Side with Continental:(1) FUEL MANAGEMENT: Current Business:  Over the past 2 years, Craig Breslau and others have been managing a strong relationship with Greg Hartford, VP, Continental Fuel Management, hedging Continental's crude oil.  The first transaction was on January 14, 1998 -- a one month Forward on Kero.  Since then, Enron has completed 29 transactions with two commodities:  KERO and Crude.  Current business consists of three crude call options, settling in December 2000 ($31.00) and January, 2001 ($34.00 and $35.00)Value to Enron: Enron has earned $9,682,084 (1999-October 6, 2000)Value to Continental:  Continental has saved $45,001,744 (1999-October 6, 2000)Possible next steps:    (a) A transaction where Enron exchanges call options on crude oil for airline tickets.(b) Financial jet swaps on line:  Larry Gagliardi has already spoken with Rick Pressly, Director, Continental Fuel Management, regarding financial jet swaps on line.   At the time, Pressly was not interested in pursuing this product offering.  Value to Continental for (b):  a more perfect hedge as opposed to hedging with crude oil since hedging jet fuel with jet is a more perfect hedge.  Enron could offer services for the whole year and explore multi-year options as well both with financial and physical jet fuel.Possible next steps:  Would Larry Kellner be interested in (a) or (b)?  Enron could also supply Continental with jet fuel physical in the following locations such as the US Gulf Coast, New York harbor, the US West Coast, and Europe.  (Enron is doing this now with Delta airlines in New York harbor).  If so, Gagliardi could provide a guest password and Enron Online identification number if Kellner's office wanted to review the product.(2) WEATHER DERIVATIVE  PRODUCT:Business proposition:  Create a basket of weather related risks - such that aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment from Enron to Continental.Continental Airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in their annual reports and periodic press releases - particularly those discussing earnings.  It is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedge for all of Continental's weather related exposure.  However, it is not difficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it.  Continental has hubs in Houston, Newark, and Cleveland.  The weather conditions that create delays and increased costs in these areas include - rainfall above certain amounts, snowfall above certain amounts, temperatures below freezing (de-icing costs), winds above a certain speed, etc.  Value to us:  Create value by designing a basket of these risks.  Value to them:  Creation of a weather hedge to protect Continental's exposure.Possible next steps:   Upper management would need to issue a directive to various groups within Continental to describe what weather conditions affect the bottom line, how much they affect the bottom line, and then ask each group to attach a "confidence level" to each of their estimates - Continental could start a weather risk management program by only hedging a weighted average of their exposure x their confidence level - or some portion thereof.Exposure areas would be categorized according to the following:Clear exposure.  Quantifiable.Clear exposure.  Difficult to quantifyPotential exposure.  QuantifiablePotential exposure.  Difficult to quantifyFor each of the above categories, Enron would also need an indication of whether Continental has historical cost data against which we can regress historical weather data.Enron's weather derivatives team could then sit down with Kirk Rummel, Director and Airport Services Division Controller, and some of his team (or others designated by Kellner) and brainstorm about different types of weather that cause increased cost to Continental.  (Gary Taylor made a brief presentation to Rummel on November 6th; no follow up action with Enron has taken place to date)  (3)  PLASTICS:Business proposition:    Alan Engberg proposed that Continental outsource their antifreeze risk (ethylene glycol / propylene glycol) and plastics (high impact polystyrene, polyethylene) by hedging those products with Enron.Value to Continental: Cost/Budget certainty (assuming a perfect hedge whereby their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging) and associated reduction in volatility of cash flowsValue to Enron:  The value is approximately $2 million notional value if they hedged 100% of their 4 million pound polystyrene exposure.  Since Continental has not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy, Engberg cannot comment on the potential value to Enron though he is fairly certain it would be much larger than $2 million.Possible next stepsThis proposition is being considered by Ron Howard's team at Continental.  Continental needs to share their antifreeze spend with Enron.  Enron could then develop a proposal to Continental that includes perceived benefits of outsourcing their commodity risk to Enron.  Could a follow-up meeting with Ron Howard's team and Larry Kellner's designated contact be arranged to facilitate this process?Alan Engberg also recommends working with Continental on a strategic approach to modelling their overall exposures using VaR may prove extremely powerful and rewarding to both companies.  David Port is already (x-39823)  looking at ways to outsource Enron's expertise in this area.  Continental could be a pioneer in the effort.  Factors to model wouldinclude jet fuel, natural gas, electricity, currency, interest rates, plastics, antifreeze, paper, and, metal.
meeting on : Mr. Nowlan:When we spoke several days ago, I had mentioned the meeting between Jeff Shankman and Larry Kellner, CFO, at Continental Airlines.  The meeting had been scheduled for December 11th, 2-3 PM in EB 3321.  I will know tomorrow if this date is confirmed.  Following our phone conversation, I did follow up with the persons you suggested -- Larry Gagliardi, Douglas Friedman and Mark Tawney -- as I completed an overview of our initiatives with Continental.The meeting on December 11th will enable Enron and Continental to continue discussions on three initiatives listed in order of economic value:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.  In order to verify attendees at this meeting, Jennifer Burns suggested that I follow up with you.  Please note the Continental attendees listed below.  Did you want to have the same origination team at the meeting or others?  I look forward to your response so I can coordinate with them and confirm their attendance.  Continental had requested that we keep the Enron attendance to 3 or 4 persons; they will do the same.Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:Ron Howard, Vice President, Food ServicesLarry Kellner, Chief Financial OfficerGreg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management CompanyJeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)We appreciate your suggestions.Thank-you.Sarah-Joy HunterEnron CorporationGlobal Strategic SourcingBusiness Development#(713)-345-6541

The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a "demand obligation," on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. "We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets," said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. Yesterday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS - Wall St worries over Enron deal.By ANDREW BALLS, ANDREW HILL and GARY SILVERMAN.11/20/2001Financial Times(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedSenior Wall Street bankers are concerned that Dynegy could walk away from its proposed $9.8bn ( #6.8bn) rescue bid for its rival energy group Enron - a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets. In a series of interviews with the Financial Times, bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for Dynegy to pull out, some of the company's shareholders were under the impression that the "material adverse change" clause could be triggered."There is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen, or even likely to happen," one banker said. "And the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good," he added. None of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified. The possibility of Dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which are advising Enron, met with officials from Moody's, the credit rating agencies, 10 days ago. The rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for Dynegy to give up its bid, further undermining Enron's creditworthiness. Moody's decision to preserve Enron's investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why Dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid. In justifying the all-stock bid, Chuck Watson, chairman of Dynegy, said last week that buying the company for a low price - a fraction of Enron's market capitalisation at its peak in 2000 - was a major protection against failure. But he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with Moody's had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose. According to Dynegy, the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into Enron's finances, possible litigation against the energy company, balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts. www.ft.com/enron.

Enron drops earnings for 3rd quarter $690 million debt comes due for downgraded firm By TOM FOWLER Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Enron Corp.'s financial well-being continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings Monday. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Enron said it reduced third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors. The company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt. The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. "We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation," said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. Enron's pending $690 million IOU is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in Brazil. One of the terms of the partnership requires Enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to BBB- on rating agency Standard & Poor's scale, which it did Nov. 12. If Enron doesn't put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it, the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership's assets. Enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. If Enron's debt rating continues to drop, which would put it below investment grade, the company would face another $3.9 billion in debt repayments, the company said in the filing, mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years: $2.4 billion owed by Osprey Trust and $915 million by Marlin Water Trust. Enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies, but a cash infusion from Dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible $500 million to $1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat. The turmoil around Enron's finances started after Oct. 16, when steep losses in its third-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the company's board of directors. The LJM partnerships were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company's new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company's stock. The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. Those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in Enron, which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating. The company eventually reached a deal with rival Dynegy to be acquired for almost $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called for an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Houston-based Waste Management. "The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting," Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation. Andersen, based in Chicago, has a large Houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients, including Enron and Dynegy. Critics of Andersen have said the firm should have done more as Enron's auditor to draw investors' attention to the company's unusual finances. A lawsuit filed in Oregon alleged Andersen's judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from Enron while it was auditor. In June, Andersen was fined $7 million by the SEC to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management, the largest civil penalty against a Big Five accounting firm. Andersen did not admit or deny the charges. Reuters News Service contributed to this story.

Business; Financial DeskIN BRIEF / ENERGY Enron May Be Forced to Settle $690-Million DebtReuters11/20/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionC-3Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyEnron Corp. warned in a regulatory filing that it could be forced to pay a $690-million debt by next week and reduced its already abysmal third-quarter earnings. The energy giant said a downgrading of its debt last week triggered a Monday deadline for it to repay or offer collateral against the $690 million owed to a party in one of its partnerships.If the debt isn't paid, the partner could liquidate the partnership's assets, which include a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. Enron has already used up its $3-billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash. The company reduced its previously reported results for the third quarter by 3 cents a share, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That would put its loss at 87 cents a share.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Business; Financial DeskIN BRIEF / ACCOUNTING Arthur Andersen Probe RequestedReuters11/20/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionC-3Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyA congressman has called for an investigation of Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc., according to a letter released Monday. Turning up the heat under the conflict-of-interest issue among the world's largest bean-counters, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) asked the Public Oversight Board for a "review or special investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP," said the letter.Dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of Arthur Andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms, including Deloitte & Touche, and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978. Arthur Andersen, based in Chicago, was auditor to Houston energy trading giant Enron, rocked in recent weeks by a Securities and Exchange Commission probe of outside partnership deals involving company officers. Enron's stock price has plunged, several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. U.S. Official Calls for Probe Of Andersen, 2 Problem AuditsBy Judith BurnsDow Jones Newswires11/20/2001The Wall Street Journal Europe22(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a "special investigation" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. In a letter to U.S. Public Oversight Board Chairman Charles Bowsher released Monday, Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, requested a review of Andersen's audits of Enron and Waste Management, two high-profile audit failures.Enron, of Houston, which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival Dynergy Inc., acknowledged it overstated net income by $586 million (662.5 million euros) and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. Enron's problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for Andersen. In June, the firm reached a $7 million settlement with the SEC in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of Waste Management. Andersen and the waste hauler paid $220 million in 1999 to settle class-action lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated Waste Management's reported earnings in the mid-1990s. In addition to the SEC's probe of its role in the Enron matter, Andersen is undergoing routine peer review by Deloitte & Touche. Dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that Deloitte & Touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of Enron's board of directors. Given the potential conflict of interest on the part of Deloitte & Touche, and Andersen's track record, "there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in Andersen or the peer review process," Mr. Dingell wrote.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Dunham11/20/2001The Wall Street JournalB10(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)[Focus on Retirement, Pay and Getting Ahead] Passing UpSome senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages. Last week, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay decided to forgo a $60.6 million severance payment that would have been triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of the Houston energy trader. Enron initially said Mr. Lay would keep one-third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined company. He later decided against any severance payment after criticism by influential energy traders, who produce most of Enron's profits. "In this environment, we're seeing producers putting pressure on managers and managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line with their performance," says Ira Kay, executive-compensation practice leader of pay-and-benefits consultants Watson Wyatt Worldwide in New York. Alan Johnson, managing director of New York pay consultants Johnson Associates, says Mr. Lay's initial intention to accept a portion of his severance represents "the continuing trend of executives being clueless." (For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million from exercising Enron stock options, according to disclosure reports tracked by Thomson Financial.) Three top executives of US Airways Group Inc., including Chief Executive Rakesh Gangwal and Chairman Stephen Wolf, passed up severance after deciding to stay at the company when a planned merger fell through. The trio stood to gain $45 million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered by shareholder approval of its now-defunct merger accord with UAL Corp. At US Airways' Sept. 19 annual meeting, they said they would remain with the company. Firm Relationship New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft last week rolled out an unusual formal mentoring program for first-year associates. For two hours a month for at least a year, each associate will meet with a designated mentor -- typically a midlevel associate -- to discuss issues such as career development. If the relationship doesn't click, new pairings will be made. CWT hires about 50 law-school graduates a year. Jordan Schwartz, the firm's hiring partner, says the initiative was sparked by a 2000 survey of midlevel associates at 165 U.S. law firms conducted by American Lawyer magazine. The poll, which assesses how associates perceive they are being treated, ranked the firm last. "It wasn't an accurate reflection of the firm," he says. "But it was a wake-up call." So, CWT created an "associate task force" that identified key issues and explored ways to improve the quality of work life. The mentoring program was one result. Hiring Blitz Despite rising joblessness, a few employers are hiring in a big way. ZipRealty Inc., an online real-estate broker in Richmond, Calif., recently announced plans to hire 1,000 real-estate agents within the next 18 months. It has about 135 agents, all of whom work from home. "We have large consumer demands right now, so we want to make sure we have great realtors," says Scott Kucirek, executive vice president of people and culture. Since August, zipRealty has hired nearly 30 agents a month for all its 12 markets, which include Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego and Chicago. The company has three full-time recruiters sending e-mails and making calls to market its recruitment effort. Its database contains 200 to 300 prospects. The job, which usually pays only commission, offers some perks. The company will pay new agents $1,500 a month for three months to give them time to make connections and sell a home. After that, pay will be entirely commission based. New hires also receive cellphone and car allowances. --- E-mail comments to Kemba.Dunham@wsj.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS11/20/2001The New York TimesPage 1, Column 2c. 2001 New York Times CompanyThe Enron Corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash. It said that if any of a number of things went wrong, its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question. In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that it would have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan.Enron has about $1.75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $9.15 billion by the end of next year. The report for the third quarter, which was filed five days late, says the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further. Enron's independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enron's financial statements for the third quarter. Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enron's books related to Enron's disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $600 million in profits in the last five years. Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon. Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., its smaller crosstown rival in Houston, and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of Enron, which is now at the lowest investment-grade rating. Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enron's core energy trading business, analysts say, as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely. The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year, and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then, particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed. Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September. Enron is in talks to obtain $500 million to $1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions. In addition, executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $800 million in assets by the end of the year, and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year. Enron is also set to receive a $1 billion infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, if the deal closes next year. Still, even after factoring in cash flow from Enron's core energy-trading operations, Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year -- meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities. Carol Coale, an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston, said the new disclosures indicated that Enron's troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed, even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced. ''Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank,'' Ms. Coale said. ''But now it sounds like Enron's problems were actually more inherent than perceived.'' Enron's deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, but in trading since the deal was announced Enron's share price has lagged Dynegy's price, reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms. In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, before the Enron filing was released, Enron rose 6 cents, to $9.06, and Dynegy rose $1.13, to $43.60. At those prices, the value of the Dynegy offer is 29.2 percent above Enron's share price, compared with a 20.6 percent difference when the deal was announced. Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares, but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further. And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger -- currently $11.71 an Enron share. In after-hours trading yesterday, after the release of the Enron filing, the share price slipped to $9. Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $500 million. Yesterday's filing provided some additional details on Enron's relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay, and it said that additional write-offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined. It said that because Enron's stock value had fallen, one write-down could be $700 million. The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet. But the collapse of Enron's stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts. ''It is not possible to predict,'' Enron warned investors, whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful. ''An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.''Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.HOUSTON (AP) - The decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of Phillips Petroleum Co. and Conoco Inc. in Houston, home of the smaller Conoco, helps cement the city's status as the nation's energy capital. "Houston already was the energy capital of the world. This just proves it," said Mark Baxter, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas."All the major players are in Houston and Houston can accommodate the employee growth base," he said. "It is easier to conduct the business in the Houston market because not only are all the major companies there, all the support is in Houston as well." The dlrs 15.6 billion deal announced Sunday that would create the nation's third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for Houston, even though the nation's two largest oil companies - Irving-based ExxonMobil and San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco - have their headquarters located elsewhere, each has thousands of employees working in the nation's fourth-largest city. It all began with the 1901 Spindletop strike in southeast Texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental United States' vast oil resources lay beneath Texas soil. "Historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries," said David Bole, the vice president of Randall & Dewey, Inc., a Houston-based oil consulting firm. "But certainly with high-speed communications developed over the last 30 years, the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers. "What has set Houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters, their vision and their ability to build mega-companies. In many cases it is their legacy that has built Houston into today's oil capital." Shell Oil Co. is based in Houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling, oil field services, pipeline, oil field firefighting and related companies. In recent years, the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as Dynegy, Inc., Enron Corp., Reliant Inc. and others. Together, they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city. "Consolidation is cumulative - a self-fulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place," Bill Gilmer, an economist in Houston for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, wrote in a recent publication. "The same principles, of course, are what draw moviemakers to Hollywood, financial service providers to New York and automakers to Detroit." And, it seems, energy companies to Houston.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Energy deal savings set to increase.By ANDREW HILL.11/20/2001Financial Times(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedChevronTexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to $1.8bn by March 2003. David O'Reilly, chief executive, told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of $1.2bn within six to nine months of the deal, which was completed last month.Mr O'Reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent over the next five years, and dismissed worries about the falling oil price. "Our business is used to swings and volatility - if you want a stable price environment you don't want to be in this business," he told reporters after addressing analysts in New York. Mr O'Reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry - the $35bn deal between Conoco and Phillips Petroleum - only made him more confident that the ChevronTexaco deal was right. ChevronTexaco now claims to be the third-largest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourth-largest in global oil and natural gas production. He said the synergies translated into gains of about $1 per share after tax. ChevronTexaco has an important role in Dynegy's rescue bid for Enron, the rival energy group. ChevronTexaco has a 26 per cent stake in Dynegy and immediately invested $1.5bn in convertible preferred shares of Dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in Enron. ChevronTexaco is committed to buying a further $1bn of Dynegy common stock once Dynegy completes its takeover. If the deal fails, ChevronTexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for $1.5bn in cash or convert to common shares, giving it a 36 per cent stake in equity. Mr O'Reilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal, despite worries about potential hidden liabilities at Enron. ChevronTexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at Enron, and Mr O'Reilly said there was "a full suite of due diligence" that needed to be done on other issues at Enron. * Enron's lenders welcomed the energy company's openness yesterday following a meeting in New York. Greg Whalley, Enron's president, led the meeting, which was postponed when Dynegy began talks with Enron two weeks ago. "Much of senior management was there and they were doing a good job," said one. Another banker said Enron management had been "pretty upfront" about the problems at the company, although he said most lenders were reluctant to air their concerns in full at the crowded meeting.

All rights reserved.HOUSTON (AP) _ As embattled Enron Corp. examines its books, the energy trader restated its third-quarter results Monday, increasing its loss for the period by three cents a share to 87 cents. The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a $690-million obligation that could come due Nov. 27.Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended. ``We are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the obligation,'' he said. Palmer said that when Enron's credit rating was reduced it triggered a clause in one of the ``limited partnership agreements that could cause that $690 million obligation to become due beginning next week.'' Houston-based Enron, being purchased by rival Dynegy Inc. to escape a spate of problems and shattered Wall Street confidence, also increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20 cents a share. Dynegy is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock. In an SEC filing Nov. 8, Enron said financial statements from 1997 through the first half of 2001 ``should not be relied upon'' and that outside businesses run by Enron officials during that period should have been included in the company's earnings reports. That would have reduced Enron's profits for those years by $586 million, from $2.89 billion to $2.31 billion. In addition, the company revised its debt upward in each year from 1997 to 2000; at the end of 2000, Enron's debt was $10.86 billion, or $628 million more than previously reported. By not disclosing the debt earlier, Enron presumably maintained a stronger credit rating and was able to vastly increase the size of its core operations _ trading natural gas and electricity on wholesale markets. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. In the filing, Enron reiterated it is developing a plan to exit $8 billion in non-core businesses that are performing ``below acceptable rates,'' and expects to use the proceeds to repay debt.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: Enron sounds debt alarm, reduces reported earnings.By C. Bryson Hull11/19/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings. The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week. That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships. If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat. Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter's end, Enron said. On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported. It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust. Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and "would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern," the company wrote. Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability. CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to "Baa3" and "BBB-minus," just one notch above "junk" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects commercial paper, to "Not Prime," a junk rating. In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices. All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner. Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity. The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock. In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of "the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complete their review procedures." Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion.

Enron Warns That Raft of Problems May Hurt Its Fourth-Quarter Profit11/19/2001Dow Jones Business News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings, Tuesday's Wall Street Journal reported. The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron (ENE) stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a "demand obligation," on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. "We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets," said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. (DYN). But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. Monday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.

Enron Files 10-Q For 3Q With SEC11/19/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) filed its Form 10-Q for the third quarter and said its previously reported third quarter loss of 84 cents a share was widened by 3 cents to reflect adjustments made subsequent to the end of the quarter. As reported, Enron was restating financial statements from 1997 through the second quarter of 2001 due to questions over its finances.On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $618 million on revenue of $47.6 billion for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. In a press release Monday, the company said its earnings of 19 cents a share for the nine-month period of 2001 were increased by 1 cent a share. Enron said its independent auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, hasn't finalized its review of the company's financial statements in accordance with established professional standards because of the ongoing investigation by the special committee of the board and the need for Andersen to complete its review procedures. In the third quarter, Enron wrote off more than $1 billion related to its failed investments and reduced shareholder equity by about $1.2 billion to unwind an off-balance financing vehicle once run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. That relationship is being examined in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation, and is the center of more than a dozen shareholder lawsuits. According to the company's Form 10-Q, the special committee's investigation may identify additional or different information concerning these matters, which would require additional or different restatements. Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divesting non-core businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations. Enron said it is unable to estimate the timing of restructuring or the financial impact, but said fourth quarter results of operations will likely be hurt by employee severance, restructuring and other charges, according to Corporate Filings Alert. The company had $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents at Sept. 30. On Nov. 9, Enron and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) signed a definitive merger agreement that would give Enron shareholders 0.2685 share of a Dynegy share. The merger is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2002. -Stephen Lee; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

And these financial institutions in conversations interviews with the Financial Times are telling us that they have deeper fears about this materially adverse clause being enacted than people out there now realize.HAYS: Well I must say I think this is very interesting and I`m surprised not that I`m an expert on the deal or even close to the deal itself but it seemed that part of the way that Enron was getting the deal done with Dynegy was to say look we dug up all the possible problems all the maybe kind of hidden not so great deals that are being investigated now and supposedly everything was on the table. So what, what do you think? What are you hearing that they`re finding now that makes things look worst than they already look? THOMSON: Well really that`s the issue. To be quite honest we don`t know but who would have known a month ago and particularly three months ago that Enron is in this situation that it`s now in and how far those problems stretch is really the issue that (INAUDIBLE) surrounding Enron still have it and that they suspect that Dynegy might have it. It looks quite more (INAUDIBLE) the deal. Now Dynegy is saying but we`re going ahead with this yes there is that clause there, yes it covers us in case we find something that we don`t like the look of or like the smell of depending on what it maybe but we don`t` feel it will have to activate it. But of course on the other hand they are going to say that but they do have that fall back clause if they need it. HAYS: Go ahead Robert I`m sorry. THOMSON: So, but the truth is you know the full extent of Enron`s exposure to various businesses really is hidden by the complexity of the transaction`s the company was engaging in markets where frankly very few people know a lot about it. HAYS: What happens if the deal falls through? What happen to Enron? THOMSON: Well there`s a real issue there that a downgrade may follow and this there`s certainly concern in the banking community. Again, that the level of exposure in counter party risk and so on to Enron isn`t fully comprehended and frankly that`s why they spoke to the Financial Times because they thought well there`s an impression that this is a done deal, that the Enron problem is solved. They`re saying actually not so. HAYS: Wow. Well I think we have just enough time to take a look at you`re you got us something in China again. You take us to that world part of the world frequently what`s going on there. THOMSON: Yeah we Beijing (INAUDIBLE) here. Essentially the IFC the International Finance Corporation arm of the World Bank is taking a large stake in Chinese Bank in Nanjing (ph). That is amazing really. It`s by far the largest stake, $27 million, 15 percent in the Nanjing(ph) City Bank and it`s really we here are going to be the first of three big investments in Chinese banks over the next year or so. There are two small ones there already where people have taken 3, 5 percent in Chinese banks but for the first time International institutions are in a position where they can think about Chinese retail banking in a serious way. HAYS: OK Robert well thank you very much I guess that`s something for investors to watch. Particularly people who are global investors.

Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)2001-11-19 22:03 (New York)Enron Reduces Earnings, Warns $690 Mln Payment Due (Update2)     (Adds in first paragraph that note payment may come nextweek.)     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which agreed toa takeover by Dynegy Inc. after a financial crisis threatened itwith bankruptcy, revised third-quarter earnings for the secondtime this month and said it may have to make early payment of a$690 million note next week.     The Houston-based company lowered results by 3 cents a share,bringing its third-quarter loss to 87 cents, or $664 million,according to a Securities & Exchange Commission filing.Liabilities from an affiliated partnership may reduce fourth-quarter earnings by $700 million before taxes, Enron said.     The disclosures don't indicate that Enron is in much worseshape than on Nov. 8, said John Olson, an energy analyst atSanders Morris Harris. That's when Enron lowered its earnings backto 1997 by $586 million, reflecting losses by affiliatedpartnerships that it had wrongly kept off the books.     ``I don't think anyone would be particularly surprised thatthey had to adjust third-quarter earnings (again) considering theyrestated earnings for the last four years,'' said Olson, whodoesn't own shares of Dynegy or Enron. ``I don't think it's aproblem.''     Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing partnership may cutEnron's fourth-quarter earnings. Enron is obligated to backWhitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. BecauseEnron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by$700 million, the filing said.                       Partnership Problems     Enron said that the Dynegy buyout could collapse if Enron isforced to pay judgments of more than $2 billion to settle lawsuitsover its dealings with affiliated partnerships. Dynegy has said itcan cancel the transaction if Enron's litigation costs and otherliabilities grow to $3.5 billion or more. Enron faces at least 23such lawsuits.     Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly andtake debt off its books. Its shares plunged by 89 percent thisyear as investors questioned whether the partnerships also werebeing used to hide losses from failed investments.     Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said earlier this monththat buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships costEnron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. The company wroteoff $1.01 billion in investments in water, telecommunications andretail-energy sales in the third quarter.     A drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' byStandard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off the $690million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guaranteethe debt taken on by another affiliated partnership, the companysaid.                        Brazilian Liability     Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnershipthat owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate thepartnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working withlenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.     ``If we can't talk lenders into refinancing, there is thepossibility that . . . note would be due next week,'' said KarenDenne, an Enron spokeswoman.     As of Friday, the company had $1.3 billion in cash on hand.It expects to close on $450 million in additional financingtomorrow, and to complete $800 million in asset sales by the endof the year. It's also trying to find investors who will put $500million to $1 billion into the company.     The company has raised cash in recent weeks by using itspipelines as collateral. It received $1.5 billion fromChevronTexaco last week as part of the Dynegy buyout agreement. Inreturn, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rights in anEnron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. Dynegy canacquire the pipeline even if the merger falls through.     Enron closed on a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. and Salomon Smith Barney Inc. on Wednesday that was securedwith assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co. It expects toclose on another $450 million loan, secured with other NorthernNatural Gas assets, this week, Denne said. The commitment for theloans was announced Nov. 1.                      $3.9 Billion Liability     The company also has huge liabilities that could push it intofinancial crisis before the merger closes. A further drop in itsdebt rating, which would put it below investment grade, wouldtrigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debt owed by two otheraffiliated companies, Enron said.     The rating drop would force it to repay $2.4 billion in debtowed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million in debt taken on by MarlinWater Trust, the company said in the filing.     Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's auditor, didn't grant finalapproval of its financial statements in the filing because of aninternal investigation of its dealings with affiliatedpartnerships, Enron said. The SEC is also investigating thepartnerships, which were run by Enron executives.     The filing was released after the stock market closed. Sharesof Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy rose $1.13 to $43.60.ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy and isproviding $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout, fell54 cents to $82.91.ChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)2001-11-19 19:53 (New York)ChevronTexaco Sees Investor Suits as Threat to Enron (Update1)     (Updates with Enron reducing third-quarter results in lastparagraph.)     New York, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s exposure toinvestor lawsuits is the biggest hurdle in its proposed buyout byDynegy Inc., said David O'Reilly, chief executive officer ofChevronTexaco Inc., which is helping to back Dynegy's purchase.     ChevronTexaco is ``paying particular attention to thelitigation risk,'' though ``we still think it's a good deal forDynegy and an even better deal for ChevronTexaco,'' Reilly said atan analyst meeting in New York.     ChevronTexaco, the second-biggest U.S. oil company, owns 27percent of Dynegy. It agreed to provide Dynegy $2.5 billion aspart of the Enron purchase. Dynegy can cancel the bid if Enron'slegal liabilities, including investor suits, exceed $3.5 billion.Enron said today in a regulatory filing it can't calculate thecost of shareholder suits.     Dynegy agreed 10 days ago to buy rival Enron, the largestenergy trader, for stock and debt now valued at $20.7 billion.Enron's stock had plunged in recent weeks because of concerns itwas using affiliated partnerships to mask losses and hide debt.     Gold Bennett Cera & Sidner LLP filed a class action suit inHouston today alleging Enron misrepresented its business andresults. Other investors have filed similar suits.     ChevronTexaco will have a clearer picture of the legal risksin the next few months, O'Reilly said. ``There is no transactionthat is risk free,'' he said.     Shares of Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06 today. They havetumbled 89 percent this year. Dynegy gained $1.13 to $43.60. Thestock has declined 22 percent this year. Both companies are basedin Houston.     ChenvronTexaco, based in San Francisco, fell 54 cents to$82.91.     Earlier this month, Enron reduced its earnings in the pastfour years by $552 million because of accounting errors involvingaffiliates. Enron ousted its chief financial officer, and it firedits treasurer and a company attorney for making improperinvestments in one of the affiliates.     Enron reduced third-quarter earnings for a second time andsaid it may have to make early payment on a $690 million notethis month, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities andExchange Commission.Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week2001-11-19 18:16 (New York)Enron Says It May Have to Pay Off $690 Mln Note Next Week     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron said a drop in itscredit rating may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov.27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt.     Repayment was triggered by the Nov. 12 downgrade in Enron'ssenior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by Standard & Poor's, thecompany said in a securities filing.     Enron must post collateral equal to the amount of the note orrepay it, the Securities and Exchange Commission filing said.    Without repayment, partners in a Limited Partnership that ownsnatural gas assets in Brazil can immediately begin to liquidatethe partnership's assets, Enron said. Enron said it's working withlenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt.     A further drop in its debt rating, which would put it belowinvestment grade, would trigger repayment of $3.9 billion in debtowed by two affiliated companies.     The rating drop would trigger repayment of $2.4 billion indebt owed by Osprey Trust, and $915 million owed by Marlin WaterTrust, the company said in the filing.     Enron is being bought by Dynegy Inc. for $25 billion in stockand debt. Enron also said in its filing that if shareholderlawsuits result in judgments totaling more than $2 billion, theDynegy deal could collapse.    The filing was released after the stock market closed.  Sharesof Houston-based Enron rose 6 cents to $9.06. Dynegy shares rose$1.13 to $43.60. Shares of ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26percent of Dynegy, fell 54 cents to $82.91.Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow2001-11-19 14:35 (New York)Enron's Azurix May Have to Sell Assets If It Can't Borrow     Houston, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Azurix Corp., Enron Corp.'swater unit, may have to sell assets if it can't find financing tocontinue operations, the company said in a regulatory filing.     Enron took Azurix public in June 1999 and then, after thewater company's stock plunged, took it private and paid offinvestors in March.     Azurix isn't sure it will be able to renew or refinance about$113.3 million in long-term debt, including bank loans, thatmatures before Sept. 30 at a ``reasonable'' cost, it said in afiling with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Thecompany also had $326.3 million in short-term debt as of Sept. 30.     The loans are Azurix's ``primary sources of liquidity,'' thefiling said. If the company can't raise the funds, it might haveto use the proceeds from planned asset sales to refinance debt andget cash, the filing said.     If those asset sales don't generate enough money, ``Azurixmay need to sell other assets, which could result in Azurixincurring losses in future periods,'' the company said.     Azurix, though it still must file with the SEC, no longertrades as a separate stock. The shares of Houston-based Enron fell8 cents to $8.92 in early afternoon trading.     Enron agreed earlier this month to be acquired by rivalDynegy Inc. in a transaction currently valued at $24.9 billion.The buyout came after Enron's shares plunged amid an SECinvestigation of the company's dealings with affiliatedpartnerships.U.S.'s Dingell Seeks Probe of Arthur Andersen, Dow Jones Says2001-11-19 15:24 (New York)     Washington, Nov. 19 (Bloomberg) -- U.S. Representative JohnDingell, a Michigan Democrat, has requested a specialinvestigation of Arthur Andersen LLP's audits of Enron Corp. andWaste Management Inc., Dow Jones Newswires reported.     Dingell sent a letter to Public Oversight Board ChairmanCharles Bowsher asking for the review, the newswire said.      Andersen, the world's fifth largest accounting firm, servedas Enron's outside auditor for more than a decade, assuringinvestors the company's financial statements conformed withgenerally accepted accounting principles. Earlier this month, thecompany reported that it overstated earnings by $586 million overfour-and-a-half years, inflated shareholder equity by $1.2 billionbecause of an ``accounting error,'' and failed to consolidateresults of three affiliated partnerships into its balance sheet.     In June, Andersen reached a $7 million settlement with theSecurities and Exchange Commission in which it neither admittednor denied allegations of fraud related to its audit of WasteManagement, Inc. Andersen is now undergoing a peer review byDeloitte & Touche, Dow Jones said.ENRON RESTATES Q3 RESULTSFrom CBS.MarketWatch.comBy Leticia Williams8:35 PM ET Nov 19, 2001WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - Embattled Enron Corp. restated its third-quarterearnings Monday,  increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a shareto 87 cents, according to an SEC filing.Houston-based Enron (ENE), which is being purchased by rival Dynegy toescape a recent spate of problems and shattered Wall Street  confidence,also increased nine-month earnings by a penny to 20  cents a share.Dynegy (DYN) is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock.Enron must also pay off or refinance $690 million in debt obligationsby Nov. 26 or risk triggering nearly $4 billion in additional payments,according to the SEC filing.If the company doesn't make the payment on that date, the investorshave the right to immediately begin to liquidate the assets of a certainlimited partnership for an amount equal to the note payable.In addition, Enron may sell the limited partnership's assets foramounts below their carrying values."The net proceeds from the sale of such assets can be used to repayEnron's obligation, " according to the company's 10Q filed Monday withthe Securities and Exchange Commission.Enron is in talks with lenders to "develop a mutually acceptable"amendment or waiver to avoid having to issue payment on the $690 millionnote.If the company fails to make the payment or if its credit rating fallsbelow investment grade, it will be forced to pay off or refinance up toan additional $3.9 billion, the company said.Standard &amp; Poor's currently has the company rated at BBB-, a notchabove speculative grade. Fitch rates the company's credit at BBB-,evolving. Moody's Investor services rates the company Baa3, underreview.

EmshwillerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal10/25/2001The Wall Street JournalA3(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major= energy-trading companies.=20Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=actions."Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that," said Merrill Lynch an=alyst Donato Eassey. "There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=Online." As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be= intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face= of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street= analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=ctions.=20While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as= the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. "In my continue=d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO," said Ch=airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20Enron said Mr. Fastow "will be on a leave of absence from the company." He =couldn't be reached for comment.=20It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market= close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =stock.=20Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,= which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=ed investment vehicles.=20Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could= be seen as evidence that "management does care" about investor concerns. H=owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as "an admissi=on of guilt." Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=al structure.=20Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=.=20Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =people voice concerns about a possible "death spiral" in which increasing c=redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=ce of such a problem.=20However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about= its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=ntities. Enron is facing a problem with "trust and credibility. It's not ea=sy to regain something as basic as trust," he said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Looks at DealingsBy FLOYD NORRIS10/25/2001The New York TimesPage 2, Column 5c. 2001 New York Times CompanyThe Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear= to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have= the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.==20The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion= reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion= write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=en they later learned about it.=20On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the= transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.= Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=ls of the transactions.=20The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's= disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=.=20By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity= that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=o address.=20Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from= complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=d investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=dity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=ere more than adequate.=20Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's= successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=g, they fell to $16.14.=20One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol= Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''= from ''hold.''

Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastowamid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry intopartnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issuedby Houston-based Enron during the summer.     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing AndyFastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned peopleare about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recentconference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor interms of calming investors' concerns.''     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC hasgot this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company isrealizing just how concerned investors are.''     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved thatit could extend. You never know what could come of that.''     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, withthe SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further assetwrite-downs.''     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack ofdisclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the thirdquarter.''     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheetwith your results? They promised better disclosure in the past andthat was meant to begin in the third quarter.''     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- allthese vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort ofquestions.''     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start ofa process where they're going to address and clean up theirbalance sheet and they've started to replace management.''     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporatebonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not anothernasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wantedto know more about it. People had speculated if it could go tojunk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron couldexist as a junk company.''     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``Youwant to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you haveto reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''--Christine Harper in the London newsroom (44 20) 7330-7982 orcharper@bloomberg.net /jomEnron ousts CFO amid partnership questionsBy PAM EASTONAssociated Press Writer10/25/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001.

As details of this dea=l, and others, have emerged over the past two weeks, Enron stock has collap=sed, falling 54% in just seven days.=20Wednesday, the stock fell a further 17% on enormous volume, signifying that= once-faithful mutual fund holders were bailing. Also Wednesday, a raft of =once-friendly analysts downgraded the stock. Faced with betrayal on that sc=ale, Enron management at last felt compelled to act; a press release says F=astow is taking a leave of absence. He's been replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, =formerly CEO of Enron's industrial markets group.=20How might the Enron bulls spin this? Likely, they will point to McMahon's a=lleged opposition to Fastow's role in the big hedging deal, called LJM2, to= show that the "Fastow era" is over. The Wall Street Journal, citing anonym=ous sources, reported Tuesday that as treasurer at Enron McMahon complained= about Fastow's possible conflict of interest. Probably, the fear was that =Fastow couldn't serve Enron and LJM2 equally, especially as he was allegedl=y making a lot of money from LJM2.=20Clearly, if McMahon turns out to be a new broom, that's a positive for Enro=n. An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on whether The Journal's accoun=t of McMahon's stance on LJM2 was correct.=20Not much else is encouraging, however. Fastow's departure shows that it too=k massive drops in Enron stock to force senior management into action. On a= difficult conference call Tuesday, CEO Ken Lay gave Fastow resounding back=ing. It took Wednesday's plunge to get Lay to sign off on a new CFO. In oth=er words, Lay listens only when the market screams and hollers. How much fu=rther does the stock have to fall to bring further much-needed reforms at t=he company?=20The spokeswoman responds that Lay had discussions with analysts Tuesday and= Wednesday that led him to the conclusion that Fastow's replacement was nec=essary to rebuild investor confidence.=20Enron culture is thick with financial sorcery. People got upset by one shad=owy deal, but no one knows exactly how the company's core energy trading bu=siness makes money. It's hard to believe the LJM2 deals were done in isolat=ion and without the knowledge of the board.=20In fact, the chatter is that Fastow and former CEO Jeff Skilling proposed t=he LJM2 transactions to the board after it was reluctant to enter the broad=band business. The board apparently feared the volatility that might come f=rom being in broadband, so Fastow allegedly proposed LJM2 as a way to hedge= that volatility away. This meant LJM2 entered agreements that gave it acce=ss to increases in the value of broadband assets but protected Enron from t=he downside. Should the whole board be on the hook, too? The spokeswoman re=sponds that the board would not have entered the LJM2 transaction if it had= not thought it would benefit Enron and its shareholders.=20Lay has shown himself to be woefully out of touch with the market's views. =Arguably, that's downright reckless for a trading company that is dependent= on potentially skittish short-term financing. Letting things get this bad =has risked good faith among Enron counterparties and bankers. It shows an u=nhealthy reluctance to address key problems until they're unavoidable. The =spokeswoman responds that the company is now working hard to improve transp=arency.=20Any efforts in that direction will be much appreciated, but is it any wonde=r people compare this lot to Long Term Capital Management?=20Phew!

When facts about these matters were disclose=d at the end of the Class Period, the market price of the Company's per sha=re stock fell from a high of $90 per share during the Class Period to a low= of $15 per share, and securities analysts downgraded their ratings of the =Company's stock despite the precurietous fall in its market price.

The company reported a share loss of 84 cents after $1.01 billion of nonrecurring charges."After a thorough review of our businesses, we have decided to take these charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential of our core energybusinesses," said Kenneth Lay, Enron chairman and chif executive officer.

The integrated energy company is expected to meet near-consensus results driven by its wholesale services division, analysts said.Montgomery Securities analyst Daniel Tulis is calculating third-quarter EPS of 42 cents, 1 cent below consensus. Full-year EPS stands at 1.85. Enron's third quarter was marked by the unexpected departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling, for personal reasons, with Chairman Ken Lay reassuming the key position.

Reliant Hires Merrill to Find Buyer for Dutch Power Producer2001-10-16 05:45 (New York)Reliant Hires Merrill to Find Buyer for Dutch Power Producer     Amsterdam, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Reliant Energy Inc., theowner of Houston's utility, said it hired Merrill Lynch & Co. tofind a buyer for its Dutch power-generation business, two yearsafter acquiring the company from the government for $2.3 billion.     Reliant has already been approached by possible buyers, saidClyde Moerlie, a spokesman for Reliant Energy Europe. The unit,which doesn't have any household customers, earned $9 million inthe second quarter compared with $26 million a year earlier.     The U.S. company may struggle to get the price it paid forthe Utrecht-based unit, formerly known as UNA, analysts said, onexpectations heightened competition will erode profit further andas utilities increasingly seek customers as well as power plants.     In the Dutch generation market, ``there aren't manyopportunities, but prices will fall to much lower levels asgrowing competition pushes down tariffs,'' said Steven de Proost,an analyst at Delta Lloyd Securities in Antwerp.     Houston-based Reliant paid 2.9 times sales for UNA in 1999,while Electrabel SA, Belgium's dominant power provider, paid 2.7times sales for Epon, the biggest utility in the Netherlands. E.ONAG of Germany paid 1.6 times sales the same year for the generatorNV Electriciteitsbedrijf Zuid-Holland, or EZH.     Reliant joins rivals TXU Corp. and Edison International inreassessing its European business amid disappointing earnings.Reliant in July tied the second-quarter profit drop in Europe toincreased competition and falling margins in the Dutch market.                            Enron Cuts     Enron Corp. said last week it will cut 10 percent of itsEuropean workforce, while Edison Mission Energy agreed to sell twoU.K. power plants to American Electric Power Co. on Monday.     The U.S. utility said last month it was considering a sale ofthe Dutch business after it was contacted ``by a number of partieswho have expressed an interest'' in its European assets, and as itreallocates capital to fulfill ``growth objectives.''     Merrill already advised the Dutch state on the original saleof UNA to Reliant, the only time a U.S. company has taken controlof a continental European utility. This year, Merrill ranks sixthin advising on transactions involving a European utilities target,with $6.9 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions.     Potential buyers for UNA, which provides about 20 percent ofthe Netherlands' electricity, are likely to be companies alreadypresent in the Dutch market, such as Nuon NV, Eneco, or Spain'sEndesa SA, analysts said. UNA may also attract generationcompanies including Mirant Corp. and International Power Plc.     Atlanta-based Mirant and International Power predecessorNational Power Plc both bid for UNA when it was first put up forsale. Central and Northern Europe are ``areas we're interestedin,'' said Aarti Singhal, an International Power spokeswoman.     ``We're looking at all options,'' said Fransce Verdeuzeldonk,a spokeswoman for Nuon, in an interview.                         Spanish Interest     Endesa, Spain's largest power producer, agreed to buy RemuNV, the No. 4 electric utility in the Netherlands, for 1.5 billioneuros last December. The completion of the transaction has beenheld up by the Dutch government, which wants at least 51 percentof utility company shares to remain in the hands of publicauthorities until at least 2004.     An Endesa spokeswoman declined to comment on whether thecompany would be interested in UNA. Endesa said in July itspurchase of an Italian generator was enough to meet its goal ofhaving 8,000 megawatts of capacity in Europe outside Spain.     Based in Utrecht in central Netherlands, UNA is one of thefour main power generation companies in Holland, operating sixpower plants. It had 1998 sales of about $800 million and is oneof the only generation companies in the market up for grabs.     Germany's E.ON owns EZH, Belgium's Electrabel controls Epon,while EPZ, another big power producer, is owned by Essent NV.India: IDBI signals SOS for Rs 3,000-cr equity10/16/2001Business Line (The Hindu)Fin. Times Info Ltd-Asia Africa Intel Wire. Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd. All Rights Res'dNEW DELHI, Oct. 15. INDUSTRIAL Development Bank of India (IDBI), the country's largest development financial institution, appears to be heading for some serious trouble. A revised set of figures placed by the institution to the Ministry of Finance has indicated a cash requirement of Rs 7,000 crore over the next three years, much of which it is finding difficult to tie up. Besides, it has also placed a request for a Rs 3,000-crore equity infusion from the Government.The revised financial projections were placed before the Finance Ministry last week by an IDBI team headed by the Chairman, Mr P.P. Vora. The meeting was attended by the Advisor, Ministry of Finance, Dr Rakesh Mohan, the Additional Secretary, Capital Markets Division, Mr S.K. Purakayastha, and the Deputy Governor, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Mr G.P. Muniappan. At a meeting on October 5, IDBI had placed its capital infusion requirement at Rs 2,500 crore and immediate fund requirement at about Rs 5,500 crore. Officials have been particularly concerned over IDBI's admission that it has been struggling to raise resources from the market due to the rating downgrade in August despite its massive requirements. It has also admitted to the Ministry that it may be heading for losses during the current fiscal. According to sources, the institution has admitted that the losses could spill over to the subsequent year unless assistance comes at an appropriate time. IDBI has said the capital infusion of Rs 3,000 crore is being sought to write off a portion of the institution's huge portfolio of non-performing assets (NPAs), which at the end of fiscal 2000-01 stood at over Rs 9,000 crore in gross terms. The institution has argued that only a massive NPA write-off would enable it to get back its rating, thereby allowing it to tie up the funds requirement from the market. IDBI's rating was downgraded by Crisil from AAA to AA+ recently. IDBI, which was directed by the Government to submit a three-year cash flow statement during the October 5 meeting, has said the additional cash requirement for the three years alone stands at Rs 7,000 crore. Of the cash requirement, the immediate need includes a Rs 2,200-crore repayment arising out of the institution's decision to exercise the call option on its earlier bonds series. The repayment would be due in March 2002. Moreover, the institution also wants to keep itself ready in the event that Enron, the promoters of Dabhol Power Company, invokes its guarantee of about Rs 1,800 crore. Sarbajeet K.

A Reuters poll of 14 brokerages released last week forecast net profit for the quarter would drop to a median 1.27 billion rupees from a year earlier, on an 8.45 percent rise in sales to 10.11 billion rupees. Tata Power generates thermal and hydro-electric power, and distributes electricity across the western state of Maharashtra, including its capital Bombay.

Now it'=s hovering in the single-digit level, and Enron is being forced to sell its=elf to a smaller rival.=20The stock price incentive=20How did Enron get into this position? Put the blame on the company's relent=less drive to push up its stock price. And a big reason for that push comes= from the way American companies compensate top executives.=20In the last couple of decades, executive compensation has soared. The avera=ge chief executive officer today makes 531 times as much in salary, bonuses= and stock options as the average factory worker.=20Apologists for executive pay say these kinds of figures really aren't relev=ant. Most of the money top executives receive doesn't come from base pay or= bonuses but from stock options.=20Such options usually work this way. Executives are given hundreds or thousa=nds of shares of stock that they can only buy from the company at a future =date. The sales price can be anything from 10 cents to the price of the sto=ck on the date the options were granted. If the stock increases past the ex=ercise price in the option, the executive can buy the stock and then sell i=t, making big bucks. It the stock has dropped below the option price - it's= underwater, in the jargon - then those options are worthless.=20Granting options aligns the interests of the top executives with the shareh=olders, those who favor this sort of incentive say. And that's true, if you= talking about in-and-out traders. But it's not true if we're looking out f=or the interests of the majority who hold stocks for the long term.=20Keeping the debt hidden=20Keeping its stock price soaring was what brought down Enron.=20To hype the stock, Enron's execs were hiding the debt it took on to fuel it=s amazing growth and some of its dicier investments, in partnerships. Enron= was supposedly only a minority partner in these deals. That way it could m=ove a large portion of its debt off its books in that partnership. That, in= turn, made the company's earnings look better.=20When Enron's executives finally fessed up, they had to write down their pro=fits over the past few years by 20 percent. But the real irony here is that= 80 percent is still a heck of a lot of money. But by that time, the majori=ty of shareholders simply had no faith in Enron's bookkeeping.=20Now look at Lay's compensation. In 1999 he exercised stock options and made= $44 million on them. In 2000, sales of options brought him $123 million, a=nd this year about $26 million, according to a study published by Bloomberg= News.=20Was Lay deliberating deceiving investors to keep his stock options profitab=le? I don't think so. He was simply following the latest fad in corporate g=overnance. He was aligning himself with the interests of the shareholders.==20The shareholders were happy with that high stock price. Nobody - besides so=me stock analysts - complained about Enron's often- impenetrable bookkeepin=g until that stock price started to fall.=20Would Enron's bookkeeping have been different if top executives received fe=wer stock options? Maybe.=20Fewer stock options would mean lower pay for the top guys. And no one would= want that job if he were only going to make $10 million a year instead of =$100 million.=20Just kidding.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

ROSEN11/18/2001The New York TimesPage 8, Column 2c. 2001 New York Times CompanyDESPITE last week's plunge in the price of crude oil and in shares of big o=il companies, some Wall Street analysts remain upbeat about the long-term p=rospects for energy stocks.=20''These very dramatic downturns are great buying opportunities,'' said Tina= Vital, an oil and gas analyst at Standard & Poor's, who recommends a broad= group of integrated oil companies, including Exxon Mobil, ChevronTexaco, R=oyal Dutch/Shell, BP and TotalFinaElf. ''They have excellent management, a =top dividend yield and are a safe haven for investors,'' she said, provided= that investors are patient and can bear short-term swings.Last week's price declines were set off by Russian oil companies' refusal t=o accept demands by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries f=or big production cuts. They were a reminder that the sector is extremely v=olatile. ''Oil could go to $10 a barrel short term,'' she said, but there i=s no certainty of that. The oil producers could reach an agreement by Janua=ry, sending prices upward. Over the long term, she expects to see productio=n cuts.=20Demand for energy has grown only 0.5 percent this year, and prices have bee=n declining for some time for both crude oil and gasoline -- as drivers hav=e seen at the gas pump. West Texas intermediate crude closed Friday at $18.=03 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, up 58 cents from its Thursday close=, the lowest since June 1999. But an economic recovery, expected by late 20=02, could cause demand to pick up, analysts say.=20As oil prices have dropped, so have the prices of most oil stocks, but not =as much as the overall market since the beginning of 2000. Over that period=, the S.& P. energy index has lost 8 percent, while the S.& P. 500-stock in=dex is down 23 percent.=20A report issued last week by the Energy Department said that while the Sept=. 11 terrorist attacks had intensified the country's economic slowdown, ''t=hey are not expected to result in any long-term volatility in energy market=s.'' The report estimated that commercial energy demand would rise 1.7 perc=ent a year through 2020, instead of the 1.2 percent predicted only a year a=go. Its predictions assume increased use of computers and office equipment,= and slower increases in fuel efficiency for cars and trucks.=20WHILE they warn of the possibility of wild price shifts in the months ahead=, other analysts are similarly bullish for the long term. L. Bruce Lanni, s=enior oil analyst at A. G. Edwards & Sons in New York, said that any potent=ial price war was likely to be fairly short-lived, because neither OPEC nor= non-OPEC countries could ''withstand low oil prices for a prolonged period= of time,'' and prices should rebound sharply as a result, ''back up in the= lower to mid-$20 range.''=20Low prices could be painful for most of the oil companies in the short term=, but Mr. Lanni, too, sees value in the stocks.=20His top pick is Conoco, now trading at $24.30; his 12-month target is $34. =''We remain confident,'' he said, ''that the company's annual oil and gas p=roduction should grow by about 4 percent, on average, over the next several= years.''=20Conoco's debt, at 55 percent of capital, is relatively high, but he expects= the company's strong cash flow -- it equaled $5.33 a share last year -- to= reduce the debt level to 46 percent next year and to 38 percent in 2003. T=he company's after-tax interest cost is only 3.5 percent, he said.=20Mr. Lanni also favors Kerr-McGee, a natural gas exploration and production =company, and BP, calling both undervalued. He regards Exxon Mobil, Royal Du=tch/Shell and ChevronTexaco as fully priced, so he is not recommending buyi=ng them now. ''If you own them, hold them,'' he said.=20William Featherston, executive director and an oil and gas exploration anal=yst at UBS Warburg, said he felt ''near-term caution but medium-term optimi=sm for sustainably higher'' natural gas prices. He said he would encourage =investors to consider buying shares of exploration and production companies= over the next two months. His top picks are Apache, Kerr-McGee and EOG Res=ources.=20Such stocks are highly volatile, he said. They are ''trading-oriented vehic=les, and short-term volatility in commodity prices generally provides the m=ost attractive entry and exit points,'' he said. ''While natural gas prices= declined throughout most of this year, prices rose at a startling pace, fr=om $1.75 per million cubic feet at the end of September to over $3 per mill=ion cubic feet within weeks.''=20He cited three reasons for the price rally: a decline in gas surpluses, pre=dictions of a colder-than-normal winter and what he has called ''pathetic t=hird-quarter natural gas production,'' despite record drilling activity.=20The tangled finances of the Enron Corporation were also a factor in the rec=ent price increase for natural gas futures, he said. Enron, which marketed =25 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas, or more than 40 percent of the =nation's demand, is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Comm=ission and announced a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity from de=als with partnerships involving its former chief financial officer. It also= reported a third-quarter loss and restated earlier earnings. Enron has agr=eed to be taken over by Dynegy, a smaller rival, for about $9 billion in st=ock. Dynegy is also assuming about $13 billion in debt.=20Anxiety over whether the Enron investigation would disrupt deliveries or ha=ve other market repercussions led to an increase in prices. While it is ''d=ifficult to quantify the Enron factor,'' Mr. Featherston said, the short-te=rm effects on natural gas prices seem to be over.=20OTHER factors, of course, could also mean a bumpy ride for energy investors= over the next several months. The status of the war against terrorism, Pre=sident Bush's decision to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, thus helpin=g OPEC in reducing excess global capacity, and a United Nations review of t=he food-for-oil deal with Iraq expected in December could each have a signi=ficant impact on battered oil prices.=20Nevertheless, Ms. Vital said, for the long term, energy will probably be in= short supply, and new sources must be developed. So she also likes the pro=spects of two drilling companies, Noble Drilling and Nabors Industries. Bot=h took a beating last week, along with the oil companies, so again she sees= buying opportunities.=20Bern Fleming, portfolio manager of the AXP Utilities Income fund in Minneap=olis, who has stakes in Dynegy, Duke Energy and Dominion Resources, said al=l three had good prospects for growth, thanks to a mix of assets, ''managem=ent I respect and solid business plans.''Photo: Workers at an oil well near Lafayette, La.

Aquila said it began making contingency plans in case Dynegywithdrew from its $24 billion takeover of Enron, the paperreported.     Enron, the largest energy trader, decided to sell after itsshares plunged this year and a federal investigation of accountingirregularities limited its ability to finance operations. Enron'scollapse would have caused upheaval in energy markets, where thecompany does one-quarter of all gas and power trades.     Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron allows it to withdraw fromthe transaction under certain circumstances, the FT said.PERSPECTIVESA tale of greed and hubrisWaldo Proffitt11/18/2001Sarasota Herald-TribuneAllF2(Copyright 2001)For anyone not already disenchanted with the idea of total deregulation of =public utilities, the most recent installment of the miserable Enron story =as it unfolded last week should serve as a convincing example of the folly =of relying on unregulated profit- driven enterprises to supply our energy.==20A year ago Enron was the darling of Wall Street, the poster boy for the uti=lity industry, its stock selling for about $85 a share. Last week its stock= was worth about 10 percent of that and the company had agreed to be bought= by a competitor. There was fear the company's bond rating might fall to th=e "junk" level.What happened? It will take months, if not years, to untangle the details, =but it is clear that the main culprit was greed, closely followed by hubris=.=20Not too many years ago Enron was a small, struggling, gas pipeline company =in Houston. As deregulation spread to more and more states, Enron began acq=uiring pipelines, gas producers and utilities.=20It also acquired friends in high places, especially the Bush family and the=ir key political advisers. And, it discovered it could make money faster by= selling and trading energy than by producing it. Enron sold many of its ge=nerating plants and became the biggest "power broker" in the nation.=20Though it was by no means the largest winner in the con game that bilked Ca=lifornia consumers of tens of billions of dollars, Enron was one of the fir=st power barons to take advantage of California's flawed deregulation law -=- virtually written by in-state and out-of- state utility companies.=20The California fiasco soured (probably) most Americans on utility deregulat=ion, but Enron was not singled out for calumny, and management saw no reaso=n to examine its business ethics.=20Contrarywise. management had visions of even greater profits, which it felt= no obligation to share with ordinary stockholders. The chief financial off=icer and other high-ranking executives set up affiliated or subsidiary part=nerships which made deals with Enron. I do not understand the details of th=ese arrangements, but neither do independent accountants, the Securities an=d Exchange Commission or congressional investigators. It does seem clear th=at the Enron insiders made millions for themselves.=20Enron acknowledges, without explaining, that stockholder equity dropped $1.=2 billion in the last quarter and that it had for the last five years overs=tated profits by some $600 million. Whether this was by design or by mistak=e is in dispute, but it is the sort of thing which tends to undermine the c=onfidence of investors.=20So much for greed. Back to hubris. It seems not unlikely that Enron's leade=rs felt they might not be punished for a modest amount of corner-cutting be=cause they had friends in high places.=20The chief executive, Kenneth L. Lay, was and is a personal friend of George= W. Bush and has easy access to the White House. For many months after the =new administration took office, Karl Rove, Bush's top political strategist,= owned Enron stock valued at $100,000 to $250,000, and sold it only after h=e had been able to secure a ruling that he did not have to pay capital gain=s tax immediately because he sold to avoid a conflict of interest. Lawrence= Lindsey, the president's chief economic coordinator, and I. Lewis Libby, V=ice President Cheney's chief of staff, owned stock in Enron, and Lindsey wa=s paid $50,000 last year as a consultant for Enron.=20Enron and its employees gave more than anyone else to Bush's four political= campaigns -- one (unsuccessful) for Congress, two for governor and one for= president. In 2000, Enron and its employees gave $113,000 to Bush's campai=gn, $250,000 to the Republican National Committee, and $300,000 to the Pres=idential Inauguration Committee.=20Cabinet appointments affecting energy policy, key sub-Cabinet appointments,= administration action or inaction in the California energy mess, and the o=verall energy policy of the administration could hardly have been more favo=rable to the interests of Enron.=20And now a couple of questions: Is it possible the unusual financial maneuve=rs by Enron went unnoticed or even unsuspected by all the savvy Texas oilme=n in the Bush administration? Were those of them with heavy investments in =Enron unconcerned about the conduct of the company? Was Enron right in thin=king its friends in government would not be in a hurry to investigate or to= reprimand?=20Or, in light of our preoccupation with terrorism, will the Enron case get m=uch attention from the federal government? Or from voters?=20Waldo Proffitt is the former editor of the Herald-Tribune.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

If =you're having trouble this Thanksgiving week finding reasons to be thankful= about anything investment-related, try these on for size:=20* "Asset allocation" is no longer just a quaint theory. The paramount inves=ting rule has always been to spread your money around to reduce risk. But i=t took the worst stock bear market in 25 years to bring this lesson home fo=r many people who thought equities only rose in value.=20Now, millions of investors have a far better appreciation for just how much= they can lose in stocks--and how bonds and short-term cash savings can off=set market losses and preserve capital.=20It has been a hard lesson, to be sure. But investors who take asset allocat=ion to heart will be laying a much more solid foundation for their money in= the long run. And don't underestimate what that can mean for your peace of= mind long term.=20* The wisdom of saving money on a regular basis has been relearned. In the =late 1990s, many economists lamented how the U.S. savings rate continued to= shrink. Some people felt there was little need to put significant new sums= into savings when the stocks or stock mutual funds they owned seemed to be= rising nonstop.=20In other words, many Americans were letting the stock market do their savin=g for them when share prices were rising 20% or more each year.=20Now, with shares down and with the likelihood of much more moderate returns= on stocks in this decade, it's clear that many people will have to find a =way to save regularly if they're going to meet their long-term financial go=als, especially retirement.=20This may not be a pleasant reality, but it's better for most people to have= faced this fact sooner rather than later, while there may be time to make =up lost ground.=20* A healthy skepticism has replaced mindless euphoria about stocks and thos=e who tout them. The market's slide has discredited a legion of Wall Street= analysts, money managers and others whose knowledge, understanding and jud=gment were clearly lacking, in retrospect.=20Investors have come to see that having blind faith in those who present the=mselves as "experts" is a highly dangerous strategy, if it can be called a =strategy at all.=20Sure, it may have been more fun when technology stocks were shooting the mo=on and nobody had much use for reviewing a company's fundamentals. But that= wasn't investing--it was speculating, and on a massive, and ultimately rui=nous, scale.=20People have learned to be less trusting about what others say about the mar=ket, and that is more likely to be beneficial than detrimental to their por=tfolios in the long run.=20Just ask anyone who shifted their entire 401(k) retirement savings sum into= aggressive-growth mutual funds in the first quarter of 2000--right before =the market peaked--because of the bullish comments of some 25-year-old tech= stock analyst. Those investors aren't likely to make a move like that agai=n.=20* Free-market forces are weeding out the weak players and the phonies. Capi=talism may be harsh, but it's efficient when the good times end and it's ti=me to find out which companies truly have talent and staying power--and des=erve more capital.=20Hundreds of dot-coms have failed, but who really misses them? Is it any har=der to find what you want on the Internet? It probably would have been much= worse for all concerned if those companies had sucked up investors' funds =for another year instead of failing when they did.=20But the market isn't just eliminating small companies that never had much o=f a future. The financial near-collapse of energy giant Enron Corp. exposed= a business that twisted accounting rules to its own benefit--to the point =that the company now concedes that financial statements all the way back to= 1997 "should not be relied upon."=20Also to be weeded out, though over a longer time period, will be mutual fun=d managers whose performance running other peoples' money has been a nightm=are for those investors--meaning, the returns produced have been far worse =than what the investors would have achieved in the average fund in that par=ticular sector.=20These managers know who they are--and, hopefully, their shareholders know b=y now as well, and will vote with their feet.=20The free market also is reminding cartels just how tough it is to control p=rices.=20Once again, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has lost its =ability to prop up crude oil prices, which have sunk to two-year lows amid =the weak global economy.

GlassmanDon't Be A Pudd'n'head, DiversifyJames K. Glassman11/18/2001The Washington PostFINALH01Copyright 2001, The Washington Post Co. All Rights ReservedWarren Buffett, who was probably the greatest investor of the 20th century,= is fond of quoting the salacious actress Mae West as saying, "Too much of =a good thing can be wonderful." In the market, such a motto would lead you =to avoid diversification and instead concentrate your portfolio in stocks y=ou really, really like.=20Peter Lynch, who was probably the best mutual fund manager of the 20th cent=ury, calls spreading yourself too thin "diworseification."Smart, witty and brilliant at picking stocks, Buffett and Lynch may not nee=d diversification, but the rest of us do. When you own one stock, you're ou=t on a limb. For example, very few analysts -- with or without a conflict o=f interest -- predicted that shares of Enron, the energy and trading compan=y, would tumble by 90 percent in a year. Put all your eggs in a basket like= that and you end up with a gooey mess. The more stocks you own -- as long =as they are in different industries -- the more the overall riskiness of yo=ur portfolio is modulated.=20The reason you don't want a super-risky portfolio is simple: While Warren B=uffett may be calm and prescient enough to ride out severe dips in the valu=e of his holdings, most investors are not. A portfolio that increases in pr=ice by 10 percent each and every year is worth exactly the same at the end =of three years as a portfolio that falls by half the first year, rises by t=hree-quarters the second and rises by 52 percent the third. But reasonable =investors prefer the consistent ride. It prevents them from doing something= stupid, such as selling all their stocks after losing half their money dur=ing that first disastrous year.=20Consider the sad case of James D. McCall, who earlier this month resigned a=s manager of the Merrill Lynch Focus Twenty mutual fund. Two years ago, Mer=rill wanted McCall's services so desperately that the firm went to court to= pry McCall away from his previous employer, Pilgrim Baxter, where he rang =up impressive gains in the late 1990s. (His big success was called PBHG Lar=ge Cap 20.) And when they got McCall, Merrill's brokers raised more than $1=.5 billion from their clients for him to invest. While the average growth-s=tock mutual fund owns about 100 stocks, with the top 10 holdings representi=ng about one-fourth of the portfolio's total value, McCall specialized in w=hat are called "concentrated portfolios." In the case of Merrill Lynch Focu=s Twenty, he owned, as the name implies, just 20 stocks. At last report, hi=s top 10 holdings accounted for a whopping two-thirds of the fund's assets.==20If McCall had spread his 20 stocks among, say, a dozen different industries=, he might have smoothed his ride. Instead, 69 percent of his assets went t=o technology firms. The Focus fund and a smaller one that McCall ran called= Premier Growth were launched in March 2000. Within just 17 months, all but= $650 million of the clients' original $1.5 billion had vanished.=20It is hard to imagine losing as much as Focus Twenty did even if you tried.= As of Nov. 9, the week McCall resigned, the fund was down 72 percent for t=he year, compared with a loss of 14 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-s=tock index, the benchmark for fund managers. According to the latest report= from Morningstar Mutual Funds, 19 of McCall's 20 stocks had declined durin=g 2001, the only exception being Harley-Davidson. More amazing, 16 of the 1=9 losers had fallen by at least half. (By the way, Enron was McCall's seven=th-largest holding.)=20"This fund has had a wretched existence," wrote Morningstar analyst Kunal K=apoor, who did admit a grudging admiration for McCall's perseverance. McCal=l's "faith may turn out to be well placed over time," Kapoor said. Unfortun=ately, time ran out.=20My point here is not to pick on McCall but to reveal the perils of concentr=ation. Buying Focus Twenty as a technology fund, and consigning it to no mo=re than one-fifth of your holdings (with the rest of your assets in diversi=fied, conventional stocks or funds) might have made sense, but Focus Twenty= was touted as a "long-term capital appreciation" fund, not a sector fund. =Here, it failed, but maybe it didn't have to.=20The manager who made the concentrated fund popular, Tom Marsico, who ran Ja=nus Twenty, took care to spread his holdings around. His successor, Scott S=choelzel, has suffered losses lately (he is down 28 percent year-to-date, b=ut that's after a total gain of 546 percent in the preceding five years), b=ut they have not been nearly so catastrophic -- and for good reason. Schoel=zel's last report lists among his top 10 holdings three tech stocks, two fi=nancials, one drug company, one energy firm (whoops, Enron again), one indu=strial, one consumer-durables company and one services firm.=20For investors in individual stocks, the important question is this: How muc=h diversification is enough? Some risk is inherent in even the broadest por=tfolio. This is called market, or "systematic," risk. Over the past 75 year=s, market risk, as measured in standard deviation, has been about 20 percen=t. In other words, in two-thirds of the years the annual return of the S&P =has fallen into a band ranging from 20 points lower to 20 points higher tha=n its average return of 11 percent; that is, between a loss of 9 percent an=d a gain of 31 percent. That's still volatile, but if you invest in stocks =you have to live with it.=20What you don't have to live with is anything more volatile. So your objecti=ve in building a portfolio is to try to approximate systematic risk and avo=id what is called "idiosyncratic," or extra, risk. A portfolio with just a =few stocks, or one like McCall's, that is overloaded in a single sector, ha=s lots of idiosyncratic risk. In 1977, an influential study found that inve=stors could nearly eliminate that extra risk by owning just 20 stocks in a =wide variety of sectors; in fact, owning eight or 10 stocks depressed risk =sharply.=20Recently, however, the market has appeared to be far more volatile, and a n=ew study by a group of economists headed by John Campbell of Harvard found =that many more stocks were needed -- around 50 -- to bring a portfolio down= to the same level of riskiness as the broad market. What Campbell's group =found was that neither the market itself nor individual sectors had become =more volatile in the 1990s, but that stocks within those sectors had, so yo=u need to own more of them.=20But owning 50 stocks is a pain in the neck -- and it brings up the Buffett-=Lynch admonitions about too much diversification. It is hard just to take t=he time to make the selections, but even buy-and-hold investors need to kee=p track of the companies they own to spot adverse changes in management, pr=oduct failures or new competition (not to mention Enron-style accounting sh=enanigans) -- signs that it's time to sell.=20One good answer is to achieve balance by owning a combination of mutual fun=ds and stocks. For example, you might want to put 50 percent of the money y=ou have allotted for stocks into a fund that mimics the S&P itself, like Va=nguard Index 500, which charges rock-bottom expenses and guarantees that ri=sk won't exceed systematic levels. You could also consider a broad fund tha=t's managed by human beings, such as Meridian Value or Baron Growth, which =are recommended by Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor news=letter. Then another 25 percent of your holdings can go into a few sector f=unds that specialize in technology, real estate, energy and small-caps, and= the final 25 percent into a portfolio of 10 to 20 individual stocks. (I ow=n 16, at last count.)=20There are many valid variations. Just don't emulate Mark Twain.=20In a letter to clients recently, Anthony M. Maramarco of David L. Babson & =Co., the Cambridge, Mass., investment firm, recalled the aphorism of Twain'=s Pudd'n'head Wilson: "Put all your eggs in the one basket -- and watch tha=t basket!" Unfortunately, such a philosophy emphatically does not work in s=tock investing -- as Twain himself learned when he sank nearly all his fort=une into the Paige Linotype, a machine that flopped.=20We all make mistakes.

All Rights ReservedFINANCE WEEK - From dealing to reeling - The legacy of the late 1990s stock= market bubble remains with us, as does irrationality THE LONG VIEW - BARRY= RILEY.=20Optimism is back. Stock markets around the globe have typically rallied by =20 per cent since rock bottom was reached on September 21. Only 9 per cent =of global fund managers believe equities will be lower in 12 months, accord=ing to a Merrill Lynch survey published this week.But the legacy of the late 1990s stock market bubble remains with us. The c=hallenge is how to minimise the level of irrationality. Two of the UK's big=gest losers from crazy prices reported on Tuesday. Vodafone suffered #11.45=bn of write-downs - but curiously, made no provisions against the sky-high =#13.1bn it paid for third-generation mobile phone licences in 2000.=20Such payments, argued Sir Christopher Gent, Voda-fone's chief executive, we=re merely what the market demanded at the time. It is interesting to note, =too, that Paul Klemperer, the Oxford professor who is an expert in "auction= theory" and advised the British government, has defended the disastrous ou=tcome by arguing that the prices reflected the capital market's view of 3G'=s prospects. The common theme here is that it is nobody's fault if crazy pr=ices are paid, because they are legitimised by the stock market.=20Marconi, which is financially in a much worse state than the mobile phone g=iant, has written off most of the #4.1bn paid for US internet hardware comp=anies in 1999. There has also been a great deal of controversy in the US du=ring the past few weeks over the near-collapse of Enron, the power group be=ing rescued by a takeover bid from its smaller rival Dynegy. There was an o=bvious failure by investors - and by stock market analysts - to assess the =true risks at Enron.=20Smart businessmen will sellat mad prices, but why on earth should they buy?= The trouble is, too many academics have developed theories of value based =on rational expectations. The real world is unfortunately very different.==20Some of the distortions had obvious technical origins. The Vodafone bubble =of 1999 reflected the cross-border takeover of Mannesmann and the artificia=l weighting shortages that developed from that transaction as Vodafone ball=ooned in market capitalisation to reach, at one stage, 16 per cent of the F=TSE 100 Index. The market price was driven not by normal corporate fundamen=tals, but by the desire of most fund managers to reach a market weighting, =at which point they were "safe" in terms of risk against the index benchmar=k.=20That was the period when investment banks exploited the idea of low free-fl=oat new issues: internet companies, especially, were floated off with only =15 per cent of the stock made available, although anything up to 100 per ce=nt went into the indices, creating serious shortages and bubble valuations.= Changes now being made to the main stock market indices have reduced the p=roblem, but there remains a basic irrationality in the concept that investm=ent risk resides in an index rather than in the underlying stocks.=20Takeovers have always been plagued by irrationality, and indeed this is an =area where academics recognise the problem; over many years they have point=ed out that all the benefits of deals, and often more than all, accrue to t=he shareholders of the companies taken over, while investors in the bidding= companies suffer dilution. Investors know this, and in normal market condi=tions news of a takeover will depress the bidder's share price. But in a bu=bble market these prudent attitudes can be overwhelmed by euphoria, as well= as technical factors relating to demand by fund managers so that they can =maintain their weightings when a bidder is spraying around large quantities= of new equity.=20Also, it is irrational that many more deals are done when the stock market =is high than when it is low. Two years ago, companies such as Marconi were =engaged in buying sprees at daft prices. Now, when prices are much lower, h=ardly any acquisitions are being made (and investment banks are dismissing =thousands of employees). An exception to the deal famine is gold mining, wh=ich just happens to have been one of the stock market's strongest sectors t=his year.=20Another important source of irrationality has been the domination of stock =market analysis by the stockbroking offshoots of the investment banks. Over= recent years their earnings-per-share forecasts for the next calendar year= have been on average 8 per cent too high. This has not just been a mistake=; they have been paid to be over-optimistic. Admittedly, attempts are being= made to restructure the incentives here, as the embarrassed investment ban=ks come under pressure from the regulators and the courts for their errors =of judgment during the bull market, but it remains to be seen whether much =will really change.=20The mystery is why anybody would take notice of these forecasts, and indeed= many professional investors do not. That Merrill survey, incidentally, sho=ws that fund managers on average expect no more than 4 per cent earnings pe=r share growth over the next year, while the stockbrokers' analysts are sti=ll clinging to the hope that it will be 15 per cent.=20A final source of distortion is the tendency of companies to offer their ex=ecutives the wrong sort of incentives. The ruin of Marconi may appear irrat=ional, when multi-billion-pound acquisitions are being declared worthless a=fter only two years. But executives with lucrative stock option plans, whic=h pay off if their gambles go right, combined with golden goodbye and pensi=on packages that are triggered if things go wrong, may well consider it per=fectly rational, from their viewpoint, to take much bigger risks than other= shareholders, or employees, would consider acceptable.=20Moreover, Sir Christopher Gent, shareholders of Vodafone will remember, rec=eived a controversial #10m personal bonus last year for clinching the Manne=smann takeover, a deal that requires #10bn of write-offs.=20In normal market conditions the valuation of equities may be tolerably rati=onal, but in a bubble market the rules are thrown out of the window. Many i=nvestors certainly like the idea of getting rich quickly. That is why many =people subscribe so keenly to national lotteries in which the chance of win=ning is so small as to be not worth rational consideration.=20barry.riley@ft.com.=20(c) Copyright Financial Times Ltd.

Enron, which has been criticized for failing to clearlyexplain how it makes money, may disclose in Monday's filing moreon how much is owed by the company and affiliated partnerships, aswell as any planned job cuts and other cost-saving moves relatedto Dynegy's $24 billion buyout.     ``Investors will be looking for anything that affects thelikelihood of the (Dynegy) deal going through and the timing ofsuch a deal,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the LibertyUtilities Fund, which owns 1.6 million in Enron shares.     Enron agreed to sell after its stock plunged 67 percent inthree weeks amid an SEC investigation into partnerships run byEnron executives. Investors worry that new disclosures, such aspreviously unreported debt, might threaten Enron's credit ratingand scuttle the merger, possibly pushing Enron into bankruptcy.     ``There's been so much skepticism about what Enron'sliabilities are with these partnerships, I'm looking to quantifythis,'' said Glen Hilton, a fund manager at Montgomery AssetManagement LP, which holds Dynegy shares.     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay admitted last week that failedinvestments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale toDynegy, and he and other executives pledged to be more open withinvestors. Lay, 59, said last week he won't accept a severancepackage of more than $60 million that he could have collectedfollowing the takeover.     Enron shares fell 48 cents yesterday to $9. Dynegy fell$1.53, or 3.5 percent, to $42.47.                           Balance Sheet     Enron's third-quarter report, which had been expected lastweek, was delayed by the Dynegy talks and a restatement ofearnings, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said. Enronreduced net income for four years by a combined $586 million toinclude losses from affiliated partnerships.     Monday's filing, called a 10-Q, will include a balance sheetsummarizing assets and debts. Enron for years has omitted balancesheets, which the SEC requires as part of the 10-Q, from its pressreleases announcing earnings.     Investors renewed their criticisms of the practice after Laymentioned during a conference call last month that dealings withtwo partnerships had reduced Enron's shareholder equity, or itsassets minus liabilities, by $1.2 billion. The disclosure led tothe ouster of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.     ``Everyone is trying to make their own assessment of what(Enron's) ultimate liability will need to be,'' said CommerzbankSecurities analyst Andre Meade, who rates the shares ``hold'' anddoesn't own them.     Monday's report probably won't give a complete answer, saidLouis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. While thebalance sheet will list liabilities for the partnerships, whichwere set up to buy Enron assets and get debt off the company'sbooks, it won't spell out Enron's share, he said.     ``What is the net liability off the balance sheet?''Gagliardi said. ``We really don't know what that number is.''                           Credit Rating     Dynegy has said it can back out of the acquisition if Enron'slegal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion. The balance sheet ``willhelp us see how good a deal this is for Dynegy,'' said KathleenVuchetich, co-manager of the $1.4 billion Strong AmericanUtilities Fund, which owns 284,000 Dynegy shares.     Both companies are based in Houston.     The filing also might offer details on the SEC probe. ``Itmay say what the SEC is looking for, and what the rating agencieshave told them,'' said Christopher Ellinghaus, an analyst atWilliams Capital Group. He added, though, ``I don't expect much.''     Enron's stock drop led Moody's Investors Service to cut thecompany's debt rating to the lowest investment grade. Dynegy heldoff on a purchase agreement out of concern that the rating wouldbe cut to junk, jeopardizing Enron's ability to raise cash neededto settle its daily power and natural-gas trades.     Enron may reveal where it expects to cut jobs and how much itwill pay to departing employees, Paik said. Chief OperatingOfficer Greg Whalley said last week that fourth-quarter profitwill be hurt by severance payments and reorganization costs. Hedidn't give details.     Jobs likely will be eliminated in businesses the companyplans to sell, including its money-losing telecommunications unitand operations in Europe, analysts said.     Enron has about 21,000 employees, two-thirds in the U.S. andabout a fifth in the U.K. Its 600 traders are divided betweenLondon and Houston, where Enron employs about 7,500.     Many Enron workers are already preparing for layoffs, saidLyndon Taylor, a Houston-based recruiter for Heidrick & StrugglesInternational Inc., an executive placement firm.     ``I got 56 resumes last week from Enron,'' Taylor said.``That's equal to the number I got in the past year.''--Margot Habiby in Dallas and Jim Polson in PrincetonUK: Trade, bank buyers circle Enron's Wessex Water-reports.11/17/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.LONDON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Both financial and trade buyers are considering =bids for Wessex Water, the UK utility owned by crisis-hit U.S. energy group= Enron , weekend press reports said.=20According to the UK trade magazine Utility Week, Enron's rescue buyer Dyneg=y wants to offload Wessex as soon as possible, and focus on integrating Enr=on's core energy businesses.A report in the Sunday Telegraph newspaper named German bank WestLB as a po=ssible buyer at a price of 1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion).

Dynegy Inc. of the U.S. is looking to buy Enron for $24billion, and will sell some of its assets, including Wessex.WestLB made a formal offer to Enron in the past few days in hopesof striking a quick deal because Dynegy may want to avoid theregulatory risk in such a sale; any bid for a water company in theU.K. worth at least 30 million pounds must be referred to theCompetition Commission, the newspaper said.     Enron bought Wessex for 1.4 billion pounds in 1998. RWE AG ofGermany, Europe's fourth-biggest power company, is also interestedin Wessex, but Enron thinks U.K. regulators won't approve an RWEbid because the company already owns Thames Water, a large U.K.water company.     WestLB has also been reported to be preparing a buyout forRailtrack Group Plc, the insolvent owner of the U.K.'s traintracks and stations, the paper said.Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon2001-11-16 17:36 (New York)Enron Closes on $550 Million Loan From J.P. Morgan, Salomon     Houston, Nov. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. closed Wednesdayon a $550 million loan from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and SalomonSmith Barney Inc. that was secured with assets of its TranswesternPipeline Co., spokesman Vance Meyer said.     Enron, the largest energy trader, said Nov. 1 that it hadreceived a commitment for $1 billion in loans from the investmentbanks that would be used for debt payments and to supplement cashreserves.     Enron secured the loans with the assets of Transwestern andthe Northern Natural Gas Co. The two pipeline systems combined areabout 19,000 miles long and can deliver as much as 6 billion cubicfeet of gas a day. The remaining $450 million loan, secured withthe Northern Natural Gas assets, is in the documentation stage andis expected to close next week, Meyer said.     Enron agreed a week ago to be acquired by Dynegy Inc. in atransaction now valued at $24.7 billion in stock and assumed debt.The move followed a loss in investor confidence -- the company'sshares had fallen 90 percent this year -- and amid a federalinvestigation of accounting irregularities that limited itsability to finance operations.     ChevronTexaco Corp., the second-biggest U.S. oil company andDynegy's largest shareholder with 26 percent, provided Enron,through Dynegy, with a $1.5 billion cash infusion on Tuesday aspart of the buyout agreement.     In return, Dynegy acquired preferred stock and other rightsin the Enron unit that owns Northern Natural Gas. If the mergerisn't completed, Dynegy will have the right to acquire NorthernNatural Gas, Enron said in regulatory filing Wednesday.ChevronTexaco will provide Dynegy with another $1 billion afterthe merger closes to maintain its equity stake.     The shares of Enron fell 48 cents to $9, while shares ofDynegy fell $1.53 to $42.47.

The discussions are at a very delicate stage, and some important points need to be finalized, these people caution. The current environment could also make financing such a transaction quite difficult, and board approval isn't a certainty. However, should the two sides agree to terms, a deal could be announced in the next few days. Northwest Natural is also expected to assume roughly $1 billion in debt.Enron and Northwest Natural declined to comment. If a transaction is consummated, it would come nearly six months after the collapse of Enron's agreement to sell the utility to Sierra Pacific Resources. That transaction fell apart in part because of the California energy crisis. A purchase of Portland General would be a very big bite for Northwest Natural, which has a market capitalization of just $650 million and supplies natural gas to more than 500,000 residential and business customers in Oregon and Vancouver, Wash. Portland General is an electric utility serving more than 1.4 million customers in Oregon. The deal would bring together two Oregon utilities whose executives and employees know each other well. Richard G. Reiten, Northwest's chairman and chief executive, was president and chief operating officer of Portland General between 1989 and 1996, and also served on its board. By buying a utility, Northwest would hope to have more bargaining power in its gas purchases, enabling it to buy more product and store it when prices are cheap. A deal would be accretive to Northwest's earnings, people familiar with the matter say. And the financial risk for Northwest Natural is somewhat muted because Enron is helping to facilitate and finance the transaction by agreeing to take common stock and convertible preferred stock in Northwest Natural in addition to cash. Northwest Natural would finance the transaction with debt and equity offerings. Shares of Northwest Natural were trading up $1.04 at $25.99 in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Enron stock was down 39 cents a share at $33.10. For Enron, a deal with Northwest Natural would be the latest twist in a five-year ordeal that was supposed to help the nation's biggest energy trader break into California's deregulating electricity market. But the utility business proved less valuable than anticipated when Enron was prevented from selling off utility contracts that enabled it to buy electricity cheaply. And California's market developed serious problems last year that made it a less attractive place for Enron to do business. Enron, which also owns a major gas-transmission pipeline system, has a history of buying assets and businesses, learning what it can from them, and then selling off the bulk of physical assets so it can reinvest capital elsewhere. It isn't clear where Enron will put the capital to work that it garners from the sale. Its broadband telecommunications business is in the doldrums and it recently said it would invest $250 million in it this year, down from a formerly projected $750 million.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron May Sell Portland for $2.8 Billion, WSJ Says (Update3)2001-10-05 06:34 (New York)Enron May Sell Portland for $2.8 Billion, WSJ Says (Update3)     (Adds sale of oil field in India in sixth paragraph.)     Houston, Oct. 5 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largestenergy trader, is in advanced talks to sell its Portland GeneralElectric utility unit to Northwest Natural Gas Co. for about $2.8billion in cash, stock and assumed debt, the Wall Street Journalsaid, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.     Houston-based Enron ``is getting close to anothertransaction'' involving Portland General, Chief Executive KennethLay said at a conference in New York last month. Enron spokesmanMark Palmer wasn't immediately available to comment.     Enron has been trying to sell the utility for more than ayear as it focuses on trading. A $3.1 billion sale to SierraPacific Resources collapsed in April because the California powercrisis made it hard to win approval. Northwest Natural Gas servesmore than half a million Oregon and Washington residents.     Enron shares declined as much as 2.5 euros, or 6.6 percent,35.5 ($33) in Germany. They've have fallen 60 percent this yearand dropped 1.2 percent to $33.10 in U.S. trading yesterday.     Some terms of the transaction, which includes about $1.5billion in assumed debt, still need to be completed, the newspapersaid. An agreement on the sale of the Portland, Oregon-basedutility may be announced in the next few days, the Journal said.                          Shift in Focus     Enron earlier this week agreed to sell oil and natural-gasfields in India to U.K.'s BG Group Plc for $388 million as itmoves away from owning assets such as power plants and pipelinesto concentrate on trading and brokering energy and othercommodities.     At a price of $2.8 billion, Portland General would fetch 1.2times sales for Enron, less than the average of four times revenuepaid for U.S. utilities this year, Bloomberg data show.     Mergers and acquisitions in the energy industry surged at thestart of the year as electricity and natural-gas prices reached arecord high. Since then, prices of power and gas have slumped, inturn deterring companies from making purchases.     U.S. natural-gas prices, after reaching a record high at theend of last year, have since plunged 76 percent to $2.413 for eachmillion British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange.     Portland General, which Enron bought in 1997 as a platform tosell power into California's deregulating market, has 725,027customers in 51 cities, according to the company's Web site.Portland, Oregon-based Northwest Natural said in July second-quarter profit more than doubled to $4.3 million amid coolerweather and customer growth.USA: Northwest Natural increases quarterly common div.10/05/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.PORTLAND, Ore., Oct 5 (Reuters) - Northwest Natural Gas Co. , a utility serving Oregon and Washington, on Friday said its board has increased the company's quarterly dividend on its common stock to 31.5 cents from 31 cents a share. All dividends, including regular quarterly dividends on the company's outstanding series of preferred and preference stock, will be paid Nov 15 to shareholders of record on Oct 31, Northwest Natural said in a statement.Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Reiten said the higher dividend is supported by the company's positive financial outlook including solid customer growth, additional earnings potential from the natural gas storage and electric generation markets, and continuing cost savings. The Wall Street Journal's online edition, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Friday that energy group Enron Corp. is in advanced talks to sell its Oregon-based Portland General utility to Northwest Natural for $1.8 billion. A spokesman for Northwest Natural, which serves about 530,000 customers in western Oregon and southwest Washington, could not be immediately reached for comment.

Oct. 5, 2001Houston ChronicleBriefs: City & State Enron to eliminate 500 jobs in EuropeLONDON -- Enron Corp. plans to cut 500 jobs in Europe, about 10 percent of its work force there, according to the company's chief executive in Europe, John Sherriff. The cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Houston-based Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989. Enron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to expand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy trading businesses have been held back by the slow progress toward market liberalization in the European Union. UK's BG Says Purchase Of Enron India Assets In Jeopardy10/05/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.K. oil and gas company BG Group PLC (BRG) Friday said a disagreement has broken out that threatens to scuttle its $388 million acquisition of the Indian upstream assets of Enron Corp. (ENE), the U.S. energy group. Company spokesperson Nicole McMahon said BG's goal of acquiring Enron's operatorship of the offshore Tapti gas field and the Panna/Mukti oil and gas field was being challenged by the fields' two other partners - state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) and Reliance Industries Ltd.(P.REL) - which jointly hold a 70% stake in the assets.The Indian government wants ONGC and Reliance to have first option on operatorship, which was being pursued by both companies, an Indian newspaper reported Friday. When the transaction was announced Wednesday, BG made it clear it would walk away from the deal if it didn't get outright operatorship. McMahon said negotiations are continuing with ONGC and Reliance who "have both expressed interest in being the operator of both fields." "We believe we have the relevant skills and experience to be the operator," she said. She didn't, however, confirm that BG will pull out of the deal if didn't inherit Enron's operatorship of both Tapti and Panna/Mukti fields, located off India's west coast. "We would have to assess the reasons and the outcomes and consider our options," she said She said a decision will be made by the end of October. BG has portrayed the purchase of Enron Oil and Gas Ltd., or EOGIL, as significant, both boosting the group's global hydrocarbon production by up to 7%, and diversifying its distribution and pipeline interests in the fast-growing Indian energy market. About 1018 GMT, BG Group shares were flat at 272.75 pence. -By Michael Wang, Dow Jones Newswires; +44-20-7842-9386; michael.wang@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

INDIA PRESS: Enron Offshore Field Sale To BG May Fail10/05/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S.-based Enron Corp.'s (ENE) plan to sell its 30% stake in two offshore oil and natural gas fields to British Gas India Pvt. Ltd. may fall through, the Economic Times reports. British Gas India is a unit of U.K.-based oil and natural gas company BG Group PLC (BRG).According to the report, the Indian government has made it clear that the existing equity holders - Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (P.ONG) and Reliance Industries Ltd. (P.REL) - will have the option to decide on the operatorship of the field once Enron exits. ONGC and Reliance together hold a 70% stake in the joint venture exploration project and have claimed operatorship rights over the Panna-Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields located in India's western coast. But British Gas India, which Wednesday announced its plans to take over Enron's offshore interests for $388 million, has made it clear that the deal would fall through if it didn't get the operatorship. "The governments role is restricted to that of a facilitator. Enron has written to us regarding their decision to exit and the new deal struck with British Gas," the report says, quoted India's Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Ram Naik. "However, it is for ONGC and Reliance who are existing equity holders to take a decision on the operatorship," Naik said. Naik said BG and Enron have struck the deal keeping in mind the existing condition and the possible consequences. "It is for them to find a solution," Naik said, according to the report.

British Gas unlikely to get operatorship10/05/2001Financial ExpressCopyright (C) 2001 Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Ltd.; Source: World Reporter (TM)New Delhi, Oct 4: BRITISH Gas, which has bought Enrons stake in Panna-Mukta-Tapti oil and gas fields for a consideration of $388 million, is unlikely to get operatorship rights of the Panna, Mukta and Tapti oil and gas fields. The whole deal may then fall apart as transfer of the operatorship rights for these fields was set as a major condition precedent by British Gas for acquiring Enrons 30 per cent stake in the oil venture.Speaking to newspersons, petroleum minister Ram Naik said that British Gas would not have the first claim of becoming operator of Panna-Mukta-Tapti fields by just buying out Enrons stake. Enron is one of the partners in the in the joint venture oil property along with Reliance Industries and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). \"Even before the deal was clinched, all the three joint venture partners i.e., ONGC, Reliance and Enron had entered into an agreement according to which, if the operator company quits the joint venture, the first right of refusal lies with the other two partners. Therefore, the option of becoming operator in the oil property is with the remaining two partners in the joint venture,\" Mr Naik said. British Gas India CEO Nigel Shaw told The Financial Express that the company would not accept anything short of full operatorship right. On being asked whether rotatory operatorship would be acceptable to the company, he said, \"No. It is too messy.\" Mr Shaw had stated on Wednesday that the deal with Enron, to be transacted by October end, would fall through if it was not given the operatorship of these oil and gas field. Mr Naik said that ONGC, which holds a 40-per cent stake in these fields had staked its claims in these fields much before the deal was sealed between Enron and British Gas. Asked on the role of the government in the controversy, Mr Naik said that the Centre will act as a facilitator to help the joint venture companies reach an agreement.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

INDIA: India Tata to finalise Enron bid in 3 wks - papers.10/05/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.BOMBAY, Oct 5 (Reuters) - India's Tata Power Co will finalise a bid in three weeks for U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 65-percent stake in troubled Dabhol Power Co, newspapers said on Friday. Officials at Tata Power , India's largest private utility, were not immediately available for comment.Earlier this week, Tata managing director Adi Engineer told Reuters the company was in preliminary talks to buy Enron's controlling stake in Dabhol Power, which runs a $2.9 billion power project on India's west coast. A Dabhol spokesman said he had no comment. Dabhol's 740-MW generator in Maharashtra has been shut since June after its sole buyer, a loss-making local utility, stopped purchasing power and defaulted on payments. Enron then stopped work on a near-complete second phase generation unit that would have increased production capacity to 2,184 MW. The Financial Express said Indian lenders, who have an exposure of $1.4 billion to the project, will also finalise a revival package in three weeks. On Thursday representatives from the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) , the largest lender to the project, met finance ministry officials. Tata Power shares were down 3.16 percent at 93.60 rupees in early afternoon trade while the Bombay index was off 0.27 percent. The Hindu Business Line said the government had agreed in principle to a set of concessions suggested by the lenders to make the project viable. It said these included allotting special distribution zones which would buy at least half the power generated by the project's 1,444 MW second phase. The daily said this would involve ending the state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation's 1,400 MW sale of power to Maharashtra.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

(P.BSX) won't buy U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) 65% stake in Dabhol Power Co., reports the Business Standard. BSES told the Bombay Stock Exchange it has no interest in the 2,184-megawatt Dabhol due to the "uneconomical parameters of the project," the newspaper said.Costing $2.9 billion, Dabhol, located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, is the single largest foreign investment in India to date.

Tata Power seeks 3 weeks to firm up Dabhol offerOur Economy Bureau NEW DELHI10/05/2001Business Standard1Copyright (c) Business StandardTata Power is expected to firm up its offer for buying foreign equity in Dabhol Power Company in three weeks. The Indian lenders to the project, which will meet the Centre after three weeks, have asked for a heavy discount on the equity besides several concessions for taking over the $2.9 billion power project, government officials said.Tata Power had earlier informed the lenders that it would require four weeks from the time discussions were initiated with Enron for buying its equity in Dabhol. At a meeting with the finance and power ministry officials here today, Indian financial institutions led by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) said that payment by the prospective buyer for 85 per cent held by Enron, GE and Bechtel be made in instalments. Enron had earlier proposed to sell the foreign equity to domestic lenders in three instalments of 40 per cent, 50 per cent and 10 per cent extending up to January 1, 2003. Indian institutions have an exposure of over Rs 6,000 crore to the 2,184 mega watt project. Indian lenders have said that the dispute between all the stakeholders should be resolved before the sale of foreign equity. They have also suggested that the new promoter be provided relief like lowering the interest rate on borrowings, according DPC mega power project status and tax concessions. IDBI chairman PP Vora said after the three-hour long meeting that the lenders have been asked to explore alternatives and revert to the Centre after three weeks. Sources said that during the period, Indian lenders would prepare the roadmap for revival of the project. Negotiations with other possible suitors would also be initiated, they added. The institutions have said that the sale of equity be directly negotiated between Enron and the prospective buyers. While BSES has finally decided not to go ahead with its plans to take over DPC, National Thermal Power Corporation has said the project was not economically viable for it. Akin to Godbole Committee recommendations, the institutions have also recommended conversion of dollar-denominated debt to rupee loans to prevent tariff escalation. With DPC having already initiated arbitration proceedings against Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the Indian lenders would also look at the legality of sale while the issue was sub-judice. Today's meeting, convened by finance secretary Ajit Kumar, was attended by power secretary A K Basu, Vora and other senior executives from IDBI, ICICI, IDFC and State Bank of India apart from government officials.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Tata Power, Enron set for time-bound talks on DPC stake sale10/05/2001Financial ExpressCopyright (C) 2001 Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Ltd.; Source: World Reporter (TM)Mumbai, Sept 28: Tata Power and Enron are understood to be close to an agreement on entering into time-bound negotiations for Tata Power to buy Enrons stake in the troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC). A time-frame is being talked about in this connection, wherein no other party would be talked to and discussions would take place only between the two sides. Industry sources said the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), which is acting as a major facilitator to the stake sale, is a key player in the agreement between Tata Power and Enron. Discussions on the sale of the equity would directly take place between Tata Power and Enron, the sources said.Tata Power managing director Adi Engineer confirmed his meeting with the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline in the presence of IDBI chairman PP Vora on Thursday. "We have had a preliminary meeting where both the parties were apprised of the situation. We will have to wait for further developments," he added. According to sources, a time-bound agreement between Enron and Tata Power would provide an easy access to the various deals which Enron had struck at the time of commencment of work on the 2,184 mw Dabhol project. Tata Power would have to look into over 500 documents related to the Dabhol project and do the due deligence before giving a concrete offer to Enron. Tata Power, in a bid to expand its presence across the state, is also keen to hold hard, bargaining over the "acceptable" tariff of the project which would have to be restructured. Investment banking major JM Morgan Stanley, which is understood to be advising the Tatas on the deal, has already swung into action and has started collecting necessary back-up information from various sources including the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, for Tata Power. While no comment was available from Enron on the issue, financial institution sources said: "Tata Power is interested in talks. It is a good thing if things work out between the two sides." JM Morgan boss Nimesh Kampani had no comments to offer to The Financial Express when asked about the developments. The FIs, led by IDBI, had been keen that they would play the role of facilitator in the sale of the Enron stake in DPC, since huge sums of money are stuck in the project for the borrowers. While even BSES Ltd was being mentioned earlier as one of the contenders, the company does not seem inclined to proceed with it now. That leaves Tata Power as the chief contender for the stake sale. The FIs are also expected to play a role in roping in a partner for the LNG facility which is to be hived off. The names of some of the gas majors like British Gas, BP, Shell, Reliance in addition to the state-run Gas Authority of India (Gail) are being mentioned as potential partners in this connection, the sources said. The FIs are clear that any discussion on the LNG facility will have to include the new sponsor of the project.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

"We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between 5 percent and 10 percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance," John Sherriff, chief executive of Enron Europe told the newspaper.The cuts are the first significant retrenchment by Enron since it arrived in Europe in 1989. Enron has been the most aggressive U.S. energy company to expand into Europe's deregulating markets, but its core energy-trading businesses have been held back by the slow and piecemeal progress toward market liberalisation in the European Union, the paper reported. The company declined to be more specific about how far it would scale back individual product lines or coverage of certain geographical areas, the Wall Street Journal said. "Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth," Sherriff told the paper.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Houston, Oct. 19 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares havefallen 26 percent in the past three days on concern the biggestenergy trader's dealings with partnerships run by its chieffinancial officer contributed to investment losses.     Enron's stock dropped 10 percent today. Enron's board costthe company at least $35 million by allowing Chief FinancialOfficer Andrew Fastow to manage LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,partnerships that bought Enron assets, a shareholder allegedWednesday in a lawsuit.     The lawsuit came the day after Enron reported $1.01 billionin third-quarter losses from failed investments. The Wall StreetJournal reported $35 million of the losses were connected with thetwo limited partnerships. Enron also reduced shareholders' equityby $1.2 billion when it bought back 55 million shares from thepartnerships, the paper reported yesterday.     ``It looks sleazy,'' said Roger Hamilton, a manager at JohnHancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares. ``If you aresomeone who invests in a company's management, it's almost time topunt with Enron.''     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne didn't return calls or writtenrequests seeking comment. Fastow didn't immediately return atelephone call for comment.     Fastow and a handful of associates made more than $7 millionlast year in management fees and about $4 million in capitalincreases on an investment of about $3 million in one of thepartnerships, the Journal reported today.                        Buying Enron Assets     Fastow is involved in 17 other similar companies andpartnerships that appear to have ties to Houston-based Enron,based on filings with the Texas secretary of state.     The foreign business corporations and limited liabilitycompanies have directors, officers or managers whose address islisted as 1400 Smith Street in Houston, Enron's corporate address,according to Texas records.     Fastow is listed as a director, officer or managing member ineach one. At least one of the companies bought and sold Enronassets, including foreign power plants.     Whitewing Management, which lists Fastow as its managingmember, received $807 million from the sale of Enron debt lastyear.    Under the terms of the debt sale, Whitewing is allowed to usethe proceeds to buy power plants from Enron or make other``permitted investments.'' Whitewing has bought 14 Enron plants orcompanies since 1999 and sold four.     Enron's Denne has not responded to written requests aboutFastow's role at Whitewing or whether he used his knowledge of thevalue of Enron assets to benefit outside investors or companyexecutives at Enron's expense.     Shares of Enron fell $2.95 to $26.05. They have fallen69 percent this year.--Russell Hubbard in the Princeton newsroom, 609-750-4651 orrhubbard2@bloomberg.net, and Jim Kennett in Houston,(713) 353-4871 or jkennett@bloomberg.net/pjm/alp/pjmUSA: UPDATE 1-Enron stock sustains further heavy losses.10/19/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.(New first paragraph, adds additional analyst comment) By Andrew KellyHOUSTON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. stock sustained further heavy losses on Friday as investor confidence in the former Wall Street favorite was rocked by reports about the company's relationship with a limited partnership that was run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer. The energy giant's stock closed down $2.95 or 10.2 percent at $26.05 per share, making a cumulative loss of 27 percent for a week in which Enron reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in over four years. Analysts said confidence was shaken by several articles in the Wall Street Journal this week alleging possible conflicts of interest on the part of Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow, who until recently ran a limited partnership that bought assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars from Enron. "I don't think this thing passes the smell test," said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. "I think the CFO should be out of there right now. In the interest of the stockholders, that CFO should be gone," he said. Enron has rejected the suggestion that there was anything improper about the arrangements, but Fastow severed his ties with the LJM2 partnership earlier this year to allay concerns raised by investors and analysts about his dual responsibilities. POOR JUDGMENT? Analysts said that at the very least, the arrangement showed poor judgment by senior managers at Enron, which recently pledged to be more open with investors and analysts following a series of high-profile stumbles that culminated with the shock resignation of new chief executive officer Jeff Skilling in August. "For a company that had a lot of question marks around it already, these questions about financial dealings are really worrisome for investors," said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade. "It points to poor decision-making on behalf of the board and top management at Enron," he said. Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, was one of Wall Street's high flyers last year, when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent. The stock's ascent was driven by enthusiasm for the company's plans to build a broadband telecommunications business and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy trading platform. This year Enron's shares have fallen 69 percent as sentiment toward broadband and the Internet soured, Skilling resigned after only six months as CEO, and the company's Dabhol power plant project in India became mired in a payments dispute. Moody's Investors Service said earlier this week that it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade after Enron took $1.01 billion in write-downs and charges that substantially reduced valuations for several non-core businesses, including broadband and water services. Some of Enron's financing arrangements require the company to maintain investment grade credit ratings. Analysts said Enron's credibility has been severely damaged and the recent reports about the LJM2 partnership had raised concerns that more unpleasant surprises may lie ahead. "What don't we know that went on at that company? Where's the credibility?" asked one frustrated analyst. "We don't know if it's limited to this," he said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(ENE US)was downgraded to ``hold'' from ``buy'' by analyst Michael C Heim at A.G.Edwards & Sons Inc.BANDWIDTH BEAT: Enron Broadband Unit Takes A BeatingBy Michael Rieke10/19/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)A Dow Jones Newswires Column HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Early last year, Enron Corp.'s (ENE) hype and skyrocketing share price enticed a number of other energy companies into the telecommunications business.Now investors are wondering whether Enron is leading the charge out of telecom. The company announced Oct. 16 that its broadband unit lost $80 million before interest and taxes in the third quarter on revenue of $4 million. In the third quarter of last year, the unit lost $20 million on revenue of $162 million. Enron also recorded a $180 million non-recurring charge for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter of this year. That amount included severance costs for cutting 400-500 jobs, loss on sale of inventory and the reduced value of Enron's content services. At an analysts meeting Oct. 16, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay said the broadband business is "not that robust" right now. Industry revenue is low and there's substantial overcapacity in the bandwidth market, "more than even we anticipated," Lay said. The company still has a problem finding creditworthy counterparties for bandwidth trading. Consolidation in the telecom sector has also eliminated potential trading partners. "A year ago it looked like an excellent business to get into," he said. "Others thought so, too." Looking back, Enron could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital, Lay said. It spent "too much too soon." An Ominous Comparison He compared Enron's move into telecom with its move into the water business with its Azurix unit. That comparison probably won't be good news to those who still have broadband jobs at Enron. Azurix caused Enron to take a bigger writedown - $287 million - than broadband in the third quarter. The water business has been a bigger and longer-lasting headache than broadband. Maybe Enron's surviving broadband employees will feel better knowing that Lay told analysts the company is exploring alternatives to preserve its play in telecom at a reasonable price so it will be ready when the business recovers. It's trying to reduce general and administrative costs in broadband to $40 million a quarter and is on track to reach that goal next year, he said. It could cut those costs even more in order to sustain the business. Meanwhile, the company is trying to determine which parts of the telecom business it wants to be in, he said. Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley told analysts the company needs to determine how much network and hardware it needs. At one time, they had thought that they wanted to use physical network assets as a springboard, Whalley said. Now they "wouldn't want to forever be in the network business." Both executives mentioned the possibility of joint ventures in telecom. Lay said other companies are asking Enron to do them. Whalley said the company has talked about exchanging fiber and other assets. The one part of the telecom business Enron still seems committed to is broadband intermediation. "Intermediation" is a term the company uses in most of its commodity businesses, said an Enron spokeswoman. It's a combination of trading and deal origination - wholesale and enterprise customers. More Bad News Expected Rebecca Followill, a research analyst for Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc., she had expected a larger writedown in broadband for the third quarter. "If you look at how much the stocks of their peers in broadband have fallen, you've got to figure that their assets' values have fallen similarly," Followill told Bandwidth Beat. "I was expecting more like an 80% writedown in broadband." Another analyst, who didn't want to be identified, said he also expects more broadband writedowns from Enron. "To the extent that they can take more writedowns, I think it would make eminently good sense to do it." He predicted "a $200 million haircut" in the first quarter of next year because of a goodwill valuation issue. And that might not be the end of it. Enron had a net of $948 million of broadband property, plant and equipment at the end of last year, he said. They had another $600 million of risk management asset receivables, inventories and working capital items. Followill doesn't see much future in broadband for Enron. "I think the business will shrink to the point where it won't be shown as a key sector in their reporting," she said. Enron might keep a small broadband group in case the market rebounds, she said. Her investor clients don't expect broadband to contribute to Enron's earnings within the next three years. She thinks Enron is looking for an exit strategy. The other analyst said Enron is trying to preserve some value in broadband. "It doesn't look like there's any right now, to be honest," he said. "They'll carry the trading operation to some degree." -By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; michael.rieke@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Dynegy Chief: Bandwidth Growth Won't Wait For TradingBy Erwin SebaOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/19/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson understands why some think he is mistaken in believing the bandwidth sector has reached its bottom and is recovering. But those critics don't understand his bandwidth business, Watson told Dow Jones Newswires in an exclusive interview. They don't understand how the business world has changed since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, he said.In announcing third-quarter results for Dynegy Monday, Watson said the bottom in bandwidth demand was reached on Sept. 11 and that the market would begin recovery in the fourth quarter of this year. Businesses are reassessing where to store data and how to distribute operations to avoid losing everything in a sudden catastrophic event, be it of natural or human origin. That's what's driving the recovery, he said. Also, businesses will avoid travel, he said, relying instead on video conferencing. Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman Kenneth Lay said Tuesday that he hasn't seen any signs of recovery in telecom. The bandwidth market is suffering, in part, because there are few creditworthy companies to trade with, he said. "They're trying to find trading partners for broadband," Watson said. "That's going to be tough to do." Dynegy isn't concentrating on bandwidth trading because there isn't "a realistic model" for it yet, he said. "I said two years ago it was at least two years away. I still think it's probably at least two years away, before we actually call it a trading commodity." The metro-area infrastructure that Dynegy and other companies are building will create connections between networks, which are needed in order to trade bandwidth as a commodity, Watson said. It's unfortunate that Enron's model for bandwidth as a traded commodity is the dominant image for the entire market, Watson said. Dynegy's model includes telecom contracts, negotiated directly with customers for long-term supply of bandwidth. Dynegy's bandwidth trading desk is staffed by four people. For the past several months, they have been buying bandwidth for Dynegy's customers. The goal has been to build a customer base. "We're looking at being an intermediary, and really looking at the same customers that we feed energy today." Since Dynegy lit its 16,000 route-mile network two weeks ago, the trading desk has been trying to fill the company's network instead of buying bandwidth from others. "I'm trying to find enterprises that have communication requirements," Watson said. He pointed to ChevronTexaco Corp. (CHX) as a target for those services. "They have offices that never talked to each before," he said. "Now they've got to talk to each other. I would say that the credit quality of Chevron and Texaco is pretty reasonable." ChevronTexaco owns about 26% of Dynegy, said a Dynegy spokesman. Dynegy and ChevronTexaco already have a large energy trading relationship which includes natural gas and gas liquids. The average burn rate of Dynegy Global Communications, the corporation's telecommunications unit, is $20 million to $25 million a quarter, Watson said. In the third quarter, it lost $15 million, down from $20 million in the second quarter. Dynegy predicts that Global Communications will break even or record a small loss before interest and taxes in the fourth quarter. "If we can get to (income of) $10 million per month - that's what we need really," he said. "If we can get there by the end of next year, I'll be very happy. I think by '03, this market will have righted itself." Watson believes telecommunications has the potential to transform Dynegy. "Dynegy is an energy company," he said.

UK: Jobs in base metals down but definitely not out.By Amanda Cooper10/19/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Dismal industrial demand and the fickleness of hedge funds seduced by more volatile markets have slashed London Metal Exchange members' profits over the past year and set off a gathering wave of job cuts. The decline and fall of base metal prices in the past year and a half has prompted a series of high-profile companies to withdraw from the market, casting a pall over next week's yearly LME Week industry gathering in London.Jobs have gone from front office to back in trading houses and banks, raising questions about the prospects for those now seeking work. "Good people can always be placed. As long as there is a job to fill and the company has a budget to hire," Sarah Gilley of London-based recruitment group Exchange Consulting said. "Where the situation starts to get difficult is where everyone is cutting budgets, people are not being replaced when they leave and there have been an awful lot of redundancies." Last week, ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of the Bank of Nova Scotia and a key ring dealing member, unveiled its decision to give up open outcry trading on the LME floor, prompting around 25 job losses among traders, phone jockeys and clerks. Then blue-blooded banker N.M. Rothschild & Sons closed its London and New York base metals units. It left its core precious metals business intact, but 20 base metals staff were laid off in the process. In the same week, the LME's largest floor trader, Enron Metals, said it planned to cut 10 to 20 percent of its metals staff as part of an exercise to cut 250 to 500 jobs in the Enron Group . SECURITY With three big market players and several major banks with commodities divisions slashing jobs at the same time, competition in the labour market will intensify and those in work are becoming wary about job security. "What we're finding at the moment is that there is still demand for traders with a track record, which is possibly increasing because people are nervous about their jobs and so they're keen to stay put," Gilley said. "So whereas someone who might be a big money-spinner with a track record would have previously stayed in their job for two to three years, they are now staying for three to five years. "They probably feel that they're reasonably safe where they are, they're well recognised and not going to stick their necks out," she said. BONUS FEARS October has never traditionally been a strong month for the the jobs market in base metals as players are often distracted by LME week functions and conferences Also, traders tend to be looking towards their annual performance-linked bonuses, which are usually announced at the end of the year. "Those who are in work at the moment are sticking. Often at this time of year, people are hanging on for their bonuses. But I don't think any of them are anticipating good bonuses. They're probably just happy to have a job," Sian Griffiths of Exchange Consulting said. LME volumes traded have been fallen over the past 18 months as the powerful hedge funds that once took a shine to the metals swarmed into areas such as hi-tech and telecomms stocks. Metals traders who handled the large volume of fund activity have begun to focus again on moree traditional clients, and this may yet prove a boon for the jobs market. Companies are seeking to fill a shortage of staff schooled in the traditional practices of trading physical metal. "A lot of companies who had sidelined the traditional physical business are now re-aligning their focus and need poeple who understand the physical market and know how to set up a hedge and manage it, " Gilley said. "The other area where demand has markedly increased in comparison to a few years ago is marketing," she added. As for morale in the industry, individuals' confidence in their future is seemingly undimmed. "Just because I've lost my job doesn't mean I'm going to sell my Porsche," one trader said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. New Power Hldg Sees Meeting 3Q Loss Estimate10/19/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)PURCHASE, N.Y. -(Dow Jones)- New Power Holding Inc. (NPW) expects to meet its prior third quarter loss estimates; and said it has revised an agreement with Enron Corp. (ENE), lowering the collateral New Power must post under a master netting agreement. In a press release Friday, New Power said the amendment to the Enron pact and cost-cutting efforts will allow the company to continue to conduct business until it secures ongoing asset-backed financing.The company reiterated its earlier expectations of a third quarter loss of $65 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. Analysts put the company's third quarter loss at $1.16 a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. Third quarter revenue will be "slightly lower" than the $60 million to $65 million forecast in August, New Power said. In the year-ago third quarter New Power lost $1.23 a share on revenue of $18.19 million. The amendment to the master netting agreement with Enron North America Corp., Enron Energy Services Inc. and Enron Power Marketing Inc. affects the master cross-product netting, setoff, and security agreement, and expands through Jan. 4 the types of collateral that New Power is permitted to post to the Enron units. Under the amended pact, the first $70 million of posted collateral must be in the form of cash, while amounts in excess of $70 million may consist of not more than $40 million of eligible receivables and inventory of New Power, valued at discounts specified in the amendment, and subject to a $25 million limit for October 2001. Shares of New Power traded recently on the New York Stock Exchange at $1.67, up 1 cent, or 0.6%, on early composite volume of 7,900 shares. Average daily volume is 223,800 shares. -Bill Platt; Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5400Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Houston, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose shares haddropped 92 percent this year amid a financial crisis, said lendersextended to mid-December the payment date on a $690 million notedue next week.     Enron, which agreed to be bought out by rival energy traderDynegy Inc. in a transaction now valued at more than $23 billion,said earlier this week a drop in its credit rating may force it torepay the $690 million note. The repayment would strain cashreserves Enron needs to back its trading operations, investors andanalysts said.     The Houston-based company didn't say in its release who holdsthe note, which is owed by an affiliated partnership that ownsBrazilian natural-gas assets and was backed by Enron.     The note is held by a group of banks led by the Citibank unitof Citigroup Inc., Standard & Poor's said in a press releaseyesterday.      Enron also is in discussions with other lenders on arestructuring of its debt, the company said in a statementdistributed by PR Newswire.     ``We believe the interests of Chase and Enron's other primarylenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' James Lee,vice president of JP Morgan Chase & Co., said in the Enronstatement. ``We will work with Enron and its other primary lendersto develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up toand through its merger with Dynegy.'' Morgan has been advisingEnron on its merger with Dynegy.     Enron said yesterday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debtdue by 2003, suggesting the company may run out of cash before themerger closes. Dynegy has said the merger should close before theend of the third quarter of 2002.      Enron said in a regulatory filing that it has less than $2billion in cash or credit lines.     Shares of Enron, the most active stock in U.S. trading, fell$1.79, or 23 percent, to $5.20 in midday trading.

Houston, Nov. 21, (Bloomberg) -- Shares of Enron Corp., thebiggest energy trader, and Dynegy Inc. fell for a second day onconcern Enron may run out of cash before its takeover by Dynegycan be completed.     Enron tumbled as much as 33 percent, and Dynegy dropped asmuch as 6.7 percent. Enron's bonds also fell. The company's 6.4percent notes maturing in July 2006 were bid at 62 cents andoffered at 66 cents, traders said. They sold at about 72 centsyesterday.     Institutional investors sold shares of both companies afterGoldman, Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer downgraded them to``market perform'' from his ``recommend'' list, other analystssaid.     The Dynegy bid ``did not eliminate customer concerns aboutEnron's liquidity and long-term viability,'' Goldman Sachs saidin its report. ``We now believe that it will be difficult forEnron shares to generate strong returns until it is clear thatEnron can operate on a normal basis without having to providecash or letters of credit to back routine transactions.''     Fleischer also cut his 2002 profit estimate for Enron to 50cents from $1.35. Enron had been expected to make $1.90 nextyear, the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by ThomsonFinancial/First Call.     Enron said Monday it may have to pay $9.15 billion in debtdue by 2003, suggesting the Houston-based energy trader may runout of cash. The company said in a regulatory filing it has lessthan $2 billion in cash or credit lines.     It also surprised some investors by saying a drop in itscredit rating may force it to repay a $690 million note nextweek. Enron said yesterday the terms of the notes, which itguaranteed for an affiliated partnership that owns Braziliannatural-gas assets, are being renegotiated and that it had a``verbal indications'' that the maturity of the notes will beextended.     The company's dealings with affiliated partnerships led toearnings restatements, credit-rating cuts, a federalinvestigation and a management shakeup. Dynegy plans to completeits buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask lenders torestructure payment schedules.     Mirant Corp., Aquila Inc. and other big energy traders aredoing fewer transactions with Enron as concerns increase aboutits credit rating and ability to finance daily business,executives said yesterday.     Enron's stock fell $2.28, or 32 percent, to $4.71 inlate-morning trading. Earlier, it touched $4.67, its lowest pricein more than a decade. The shares have plummeted 92 percent thisyear. Dynegy fell $2.70, or 6.5 percent, to $39.00. The shareshad dropped 26 percent this year.U.S. Equity Movers: Cardiac Science, Enron, Guidant, TriQuint2001-11-21 10:24 (New York)U.S. Equity Movers: Cardiac Science, Enron, Guidant, TriQuint     New York, Nov. 21 (Bloomberg) -- The following is a list ofcompanies whose shares are moving in U.S. markets Wednesday, Nov.21.

But Monday's disclosure that Enron faced $690 million in bond pay=ments next week reignited worries that the company faced steeper challenges= than it has detailed.

EmshwillerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal10/24/2001The Wall Street JournalA2(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron shares, diluting the position of current shareholders. However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months.Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. "There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. "But if we are wrong, we will issue equity." Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. During the past week, shares of the energy-trading giant have dropped more than 40%. Early last week, Enron reported a $618 million third-quarter loss, resulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. The company also disclosed a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminating certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed by Enron Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow. In July, Mr. Fastow ended his connection to the partnership in the face of growing concerns by analysts and major investors. On Monday, Enron disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the transactions related to Mr. Fastow. Enron has said its dealings with the partnership were proper. The turmoil of the past several days prompted Enron to schedule a conference call yesterday morning with Wall Street analysts and others in an effort to reassure investors. Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said while "we are extremely disappointed with our stock price . . . our businesses are performing very well." Mr. Lay and other executives said Enron has adequate liquidity to meet its needs. Mr. Fastow, the chief financial officer, took part in the conference call. But neither he nor Mr. Lay would answer any questions concerning the Fastow-related partnership, which was known as LJM2 Co-Investment LP. Mr. Lay said the SEC was in the midst of an inquiry concerning that partnership arrangement, which has raised conflict-of-interest questions among analysts and others. Mr. Lay cited shareholder suits filed recently as another reason not to discuss the partnership questions. Mr. Lay said he was "very concerned about the way Andy's character has been loosely tossed about." He added "we continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy." Internal LJM2 documents indicate that Mr. Fastow and perhaps a handful of fellow Enron officials made millions of dollars in management fees and capital increases from running the partnership. Billions of dollars of Enron assets and stock were involved in LJM2-related transactions, according to Enron SEC filings. During the conference call, analysts -- even some who have been longtime Enron fans -- challenged executives about the Fastow partnership arrangement and the company's often opaque financial reports. "There's the appearance you are hiding something," said Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer. "You need to do everything in your power to demonstrate to investors that your dealings are above board." Mr. Lay responded, "We're trying to be as transparent as we can."Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Business/Financial Desk; Section CEnron Tries To Dismiss Finance DoubtsBy FLOYD NORRIS10/24/2001The New York TimesPage 1, Column 5c. 2001 New York Times CompanyEnron has ample access to cash, the company's chief executive said yesterday as he assured investors that there was no need for additional write-offs stemming from unusual financing activities. In a conference call with investors that was hastily scheduled after Enron's stock plunged on Monday, the chief executive, Kenneth W. Lay, strongly defended the company's chief financial officer and said there was no conflict of interest involved in transactions that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into.But he refused to go into detail on the transaction that Enron made with partnerships run by Andrew S. Fastow, the chief financial officer. In addition, Mr. Fastow, while declaring that Enron ''expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations,'' declined to answer any questions about it. The conference call, which began just as trading opened on the New York Stock Exchange, at first seemed to be reassuring investors. Within minutes of the beginning of the call, the share price rallied to $23.25. But it soon began falling, and ended the day down 86 cents, at $19.79. The day's low of $19.62 was the lowest since Jan. 12, 1998, and was down 78 percent from the high set by the stock in the summer of 2000. Until recently, most investors focused on the company's reported operating earnings, which showed good results as it became a leading player in energy markets. But the focus has shifted to a series of transactions, some involving off-balance-sheet financing. One, involving partnerships controlled by Mr. Fastow, led to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity that raised concern last week and led to S.E.C. inquiries that the company disclosed on Monday. One of the company's strongest supporters has been David Fleischer, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs. But he told Mr. Lay on the call yesterday that Enron had to be more forthcoming with information. ''There is an appearance that you are hiding something,'' he said. After the call, Mr. Fleischer expressed disappointment. ''They've engaged in a number of transactions that one wonders about, and that are hard to understand,'' he said in an interview. ''They have not been as forthcoming in explaining them'' as is needed, he said. But he said he was still recommending the stock. ''I don't think accountants and auditors would have allowed total shenanigans,'' he said. ''In the absence of total shenanigans going on at this company, there is tremendous value here.'' Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiries as a reason for not discussing details on the transactions involving the partnerships that were controlled by Mr. Fastow. But he emphasized that both he and the company's board ''continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy.'' Mr. Lay said that auditors from Arthur Andersen had carefully reviewed Enron's reporting in conjunction with another off-balance-sheet vehicle, called Marlin. That company owns one-third of Azurix, an Enron subsidiary that owns Wessex, a British water utility. The auditors ''have determined there is no write-down required,'' he said under questioning by Richard Grubman of Highfields Capital Management, a money management firm. Mr. Grubman said that Marlin owed almost $1 billion on debt that was guaranteed by Enron but had no assets other than the Azurix stake. Noting that Enron had paid about $300 million to buy a third of Azurix from public shareholders and had since taken write-downs on its investment in Azurix, Mr. Grubman asked why the company was not setting up reserves to cover its exposure on that debt, which under a complicated arrangement could end up being satisfied through the issuance of Enron shares. Mr. Lay said that no action was needed but declined to address details. Eventually he cut off Mr. Grubman. ''I know you're trying to drive the stock price down, and you've done a pretty good job of it,'' Mr. Lay said. ''But let's move on to the next question.'' Mr. Fastow said the company was having no problem issuing commercial paper and had $1.85 billion in such debt outstanding. He said it was backed by $3.35 billion in bank lines of credit, of which $1.75 billion will expire next May if it is not renewed. Mr. Lay said he was sorry about ''the misunderstanding'' that resulted when his brief mention of the $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity in a conference call last week was not noticed by some analysts. That reduction would have been apparent if the company had released its balance sheet with the earnings report, but it did not. He said the company would consider releasing balance sheets with earnings reports in the future, but made no promises. The large reduction in shareholder equity did not affect reported earnings, and so was not in the earnings release. But it raised concerns that some of the sophisticated financing techniques used by the company might be effectively keeping losses off the earnings statement. The S.E.C. is expected to look into whether the accounting for that transaction was correct. After one questioner on the call said it would be easier to understand Enron if it released financial statements for the special purpose vehicles that were set up to enter into such transactions as Marlin, Mr. Lay said the company ''will look into providing'' such statements.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Options ReportSurge in Optimism Prompts Straddles In Enron and CiscoBy Kopin TanDow Jones Newswires10/24/2001The Wall Street JournalC14(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -- Bullish calls traded heavily early as investors, encouraged by the ability of stocks to shrug off anthrax scares, bought calls to replace stock holdings and to ride any rallies. At one point, the ratio of equity calls traded to puts at the Chicago Board Options Exchange fell to 0.28, compared with 0.68 Friday and Monday's three-month closing low of 0.42.The surge of optimism -- also evident in the CBOE market-volatility index, or VIX -- prompted traders to begin covering the downside, just as the widely watched stock indexes began to retreat. Contrarians believe the CBOE equity put/call ratio sends a bearish signal when it is below 0.40. By the session's end, the ratio was at 0.49. Buyers drove robust call trading in Cisco Systems, a maker of Internet switching equipment, and the implied volatility also rose, noted a trader at Letco, the CBOE specialist for Cisco options. One investor bought thousands of January 20 calls, paying about $115 a contract for the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at $20 a share until mid-January. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Cisco was down 42 cents at $16.41. The January 20 calls fell 10 cents to 90 cents on CBOE volume of 27,048 contracts, while 6,861 contracts traded at the Pacific Exchange. The implied volatility of Enron's near-month options remains high, even as the energy concern's executives sought to calm investors and address their concerns, following news that the Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at the Houston company. The volatility spike makes Enron a viable candidate for investors looking to sell straddles -- selling calls and puts with the same strike price and expiration. In particular, Enron's at-the-money January 20 straddles offer rich premiums, said Lillian Seidman of the Seidman/Skupp options team at Miller Tabak & Co., of New York. With Enron down 86 cents at $19.79 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, selling January 20 straddles would earn an investor about $750 a straddle -- a rich premium that could offset the cost of buying stock. To be sure, selling straddles can be risky and the losses significant if the stock, which already had fallen about 38% in a week, makes a big move in either direction before the straddles expire. Investors typically buy straddles if they expect a big move in the underlying stock, while sellers pocket premium and hope the stock remains in a tight trading range.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Houston-based energy trader has been caught in a storm of criticism over Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow's former role with two partnerships, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment, that entered into complex financing and hedging arrangements with Enron. Enron disclosed Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission opened an "informal inquiry" into transactions between Enron and the two partnerships. It declined to say if the SEC is looking into other transactions. After the disclosure, Enron's stock fell almost 21 percent Monday. Tuesday it dropped another 86 cents to close at $19.79. The news brought to the forefront ongoing complaints from some on Wall Street that some of Enron's financial mechanisms are difficult to understand and that Enron doesn't provide detailed enough financial data about its performance. Tuesday morning, Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay held a conference call for investors and analysts, aimed at addressing their concerns. It remains to be seen whether he succeeded, but based on the tenor of questions during the call, it's doubtful he achieved that result. David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, told Lay that the company's credibility was being severely questioned and called on him to do everything in his power to explain to investors that Enron's dealings are aboveboard. "I, for one, find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of all those transactions," he said. Lay told callers he was limited in speaking about the LJM partnerships because of the SEC inquiry. He did say Enron was aware an "inherent conflict of interest" would result from its chief financial officer running investment partnerships doing business with Enron. In response, Enron set up procedures, which Lay said were rigorously followed, to ensure shareholder interests wouldn't be compromised. "There was a Chinese Wall between LJM and Enron," he said, adding that Enron wasn't obligated to do deals with the LJM entities and did so when it was in Enron's best interest. Lay and Enron's board continue to have the "highest faith and confidence" in Fastow, he added. Fastow resigned his roles with the LJM entities in June after criticism from Wall Street. Enron ended its financial relationships with the partnerships. It took a $35 million charge in the third quarter and reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion as a result. During the call Enron executives also addressed other issues. They stressed that Enron expects to continue having sufficient liquidity to carry out normal operations and took questions about two financing vehicles, Whitewing and the Atlantic Water Trust, that it set up so it could invest in certain assets without issuing debt or Enron shares at the time of the investments. If Enron should lose its current investment-grade quality debt rating, commitments made as part of those financing vehicles could trigger steps that would cause the value of Enron's current outstanding shares to become diluted. Jeff Dietert, an analyst with Simmons & Co. International in Houston who follows Enron, was among those on the call. He said afterward he received some new information about Enron's lines of credit. "I had hoped to get a little bit more out of the call," he said. OBSERVER - Busy signal.10/24/2001Financial Times (U.K. edition)(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights ReservedBusy signal Enron should know plenty about bandwidth.Through Enron Broadband Services, the giant energy company boasts about "developing an open and efficient market for bandwidth that provides liquidity, reliability, price transparency and guaranteed service levels". But there were no guarantees about service levels yesterday, when Enron held a conference call to "address investor concerns" about its financial dealings. Despite the bandwidth expertise, the call - the first time that Andrew Fastow, chief financial officer, has faced questions about the transactions from analysts - was available to just 300 lucky telephone diallers. A live webcast of the call was accessible on Enron's website, but without the chance to grill Enron brass. Those investors and journalists who did make it through (some waited 20 minutes for their place at the party; others found their lines dropped mid-stream) heard volatile exchanges between analysts and company executives. An analyst chided for his part in lowering the company's share price was told by Ken Lay, Enron's chairman, that his question quota was up and it was time to move on.

USA: Enron mulls ways to cover portfolio shortfalls-WSJ.10/24/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. Treasurer Ben Glisan said the company thinks it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes sold by investment vehicles it created without having to issue more stock, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. Enron may need to come up with funds to cover potential shortfalls in those investment vehicles, which could involve issuing additional shares, thereby diluting the position of current shareholders, the report said.The report, which cites a Tuesday interview with Glisan, said the notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities and are coming due during the next 20 months. The entities are known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I Inc, the report said. According to the report, Glisan said assets from those entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Enron is selling other assets, the report said. According to the newspaper, proceeds from those sales could go toward repaying the notes, which are ultimately guaranteed by Enron. Glisan, according to the report, said it looks like asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of 2002. "There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds" to repay the notes, Glisan said, according to the report. "But if we are wrong, we will issue equity." According to the report, Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron held a conference call on Tuesday, seeking to assuage investor concerns after U.S. regulators said they were looking into transactions involving the company's chief financial officer and its stock shed more than $10 billion in value over the past week. Enron said on the call it can tap $3.35 billion from a credit line, suggesting it has enough liquidity to operate its core trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in cash flow, depending on commodity prices and market hedges.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron May Issue More Stock to Cover Obligations10/24/2001Dow Jones Business News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Enron Corp. might have to come up with several hundred million dollars or more during the next 20 months to cover potential shortfalls in investment vehicles it created, Wednesday's Wall Street Journal reported. Covering such shortfalls could involve issuing additional Enron (ENE) shares, diluting the position of current shareholders.However, Enron Treasurer Ben Glisan said in an interview yesterday that the company believes it can repay about $3.3 billion in notes that were sold by those investment vehicles without having to resort to issuing more stock. The notes were sold to investors during recent years by several entities -- known as the Marlin Water Trust II, the Marlin Water Capital Corp. II, the Osprey Trust and Osprey I, Inc. The notes are coming due during the next 20 months. Mr. Glisan said assets from the entities could be sold to pay off some of the notes. Also, Enron is selling other assets. Proceeds from those transactions also could go toward repaying the notes, which ultimately are guaranteed by Enron. He said it appears that asset sales will raise at least $2.2 billion by the end of next year. This amount includes cash proceeds of $1.55 billion from the previously announced sale of Enron's Portland General Electric utility unit. Enron hopes to complete that sale by the end of 2002. "There are a number of other assets we believe will raise sufficient proceeds" to repay the notes, Mr. Glisan said. "But if we are wrong, we will issue equity." Mr. Glisan said a worst-case scenario would involve issuing as much as $1 billion in stock. Enron said it has about 850 million shares outstanding. Making up any shortfall with equity has become more expensive because of the drop in Enron's share price. In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were down 86 cents to $19.79. The stock was once again one of the most actively traded with about 27 million shares changing hands. Early this year, Enron stock was more than $80 a share. Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Abreast of the MarketEverest Re, St. Paul and Providian Drop, but Markets Stay ResilientBy Robert O'BrienDow Jones Newswires10/24/2001The Wall Street JournalC2(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -- Stocks ended only slightly lower as the recently resilient market largely withstood the effects of dismal corporate profit statements. Shares of drug maker Pharmacia fell $4.37, or 13%, to $38.39, after the company issued third-quarter results that topped Wall Street's forecasts, but also issued 2002 profit projections that left some analysts disappointed.In fact, several drug companies saw their stock prices fall as investors responded to their quarterly profit statements. Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, for example, gave up 1.68, or 2.8%, to 58.02, American Home Products lost 1.40, or 2.3%, to 58.90, and Schering-Plough eased 74 cents, or 1.9%, to 38.17. Shares of several insurance and reinsurance providers also pulled back in reaction to profit statements, with Everest Re falling 6.40, or 8.4%, to 69.50, and St. Paul dropping 93 cents, or 1.9%, to 49.25. Power utility Exelon, Chicago, was set back 3.42, or 7.7%, to 41.08, after its third-quarter results topped forecasts, but drew critical comments from several analysts. Nevertheless, even with the grim earnings outlook, investors showed continued reluctance to throw in the towel. "Institutional investors are busy trying to gauge the sentiment in the market," Richard Cripps, market strategist at Legg Mason, said. "Their fear is that the market makes a four or five percent upside run very quickly, which is eminently possible, and they can't afford to miss it." Some seasonal factors also have played a role in supporting stock prices recently. For many mutual funds, for example, their fiscal year concludes at the end of October. Some are doing what is called window dressing -- buying stocks that their investment disciplines say should be in their portfolio -- while others need to boost their overall exposure to the equities market. Whatever the reason, the market has been making some big moves when prices have risen, and modest moves when they have declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which ran up 172.92 points Monday, declined 36.95 points yesterday, a loss of 0.39%, to 9340.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 3.64 points, or 0.21%, to 1704.44. Volume levels showed some improvement over Monday's rather sluggish pace. Investors haven't completely rolled over. In a handful of the situations in which their ire has been raised, they have lashed those stocks repeatedly. Shares of SBC Communications, one of Monday's disappointments, got punished again, falling 2.62, or 6.3%, to 38.78, and fell back in range of a 52-week low of 38.20, set June 26. Consumer lender Providian Financial got sent to a fresh 52-week low, off 41 cents, or 8.3%, to 4.55. Enron, which has fallen on concerns about conflicts of interest in dealings among the company, a power marketer, and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, dropped an additional 86 cents, or 4.2%, to 19.79, hitting a 52-week low intraday. There were some winning profit statements. Shares of CSX, for example, rose 2.45, or 7.5%, to 35.19, after the Richmond, Va., rail-freight concern reported third-quarter earnings that, while they fell short of year-ago performance, nevertheless managed to top Wall Street's forecasts. Vitesse Semiconductor (Nasdaq), a Camarillo, Calif., maker of integrated circuits used in high-bandwidth communications networks, added 43 cents, or 4.5%, to 9.99, even though the company's losses for its fiscal fourth quarter proved sharper than expected. NetIQ (Nasdaq) dropped 4.23, or 14%, to 26.17, even though the Santa Clara, Calif., developer of networking software posted fiscal first-quarter results late Monday that topped what analysts had been looking for. Chartered Semiconductor (Nasdaq) advanced 40 cents, or 2.1%, to 19.10. The Singapore chip foundry reported third-quarter results that showed a loss for the period, but nevertheless proved to be a little more encouraging than analysts had projected. Shares of several cable-television operators moved higher. Charter Communications added 59 cents, or 4.5%, to 13.62, Comcast gained 40 cents, or 1.1%, to 36.82, and Cox Communications rose 44 cents, or 1.1%, to 40.15. Thomas Weisel Partners said that cable operators should benefit from SBC Communications' decision, revealed Monday with its quarterly results, to scale back the growth of its digital subscriber line service offering. EarthLink (Nasdaq) slid 2.51, or 14%, to 14.85. The Atlanta Internet service provider issued stronger-than-expected third-quarter results, but also signaled that its customer growth had slowed. AT&T Wireless increased 1.26, or 9.7%, to 14.20. The Redmond, Wash., provider of wireless communications services reported third-quarter results that topped what analysts had been looking for. Several steelmakers moved higher following a ruling late Monday by the U.S. Trade Commission, which said it determined that domestic steelmakers have been significantly harmed by cheap imports; the ruling could lead to the erection of barriers limiting steel imports. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 28 cents, or 1.9%, to 15.02, Nucor rose 1.05, or 2.5%, to 42.87, and AK Steel improved 41 cents, or 4.6%, to 9.31. McKesson advanced 1.56, or 4.2%, to 38.95. The San Francisco drug distributor and health-care information technology provider posted stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter results. Watson Pharmaceuticals fell 3.05, or 6%, to 48.11. UBS Warburg reduced its rating on the Corona, Calif., drug maker, and lowered its earnings projections for the company. Furniture Brands dropped 2.04, or 8.9%, to 20.96. UBS Warburg cut its rating on the St. Louis furniture manufacturer, saying it believes the company has lost market share to rival manufacturers.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

AES and Enron are the only major American power companies to make big investments in India since the government allowed foreign investment in the sector in the early 1990s.

UK: LNG delays could spawn shipping crisis - analysts.By Pete Harrison10/24/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.LONDON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The transport chain supporting the global LNG industry will be finely poised in coming years between profitability and a crisis of oversupply if projects miss their deadlines, shipping analysts warn. More LNG tankers than ever before are being constructed in the shipyards of the Far East, many of them ordered speculatively against anticipated demand, which might emerge later than scheduled."The issue is timing," Jarle Sjo, shipping equity analyst at Oslo-based investment bank First Securities told Reuters. "Historically, LNG projects have been delayed - you can estimate at about six months - and if that happens it will probably get ugly in the short term," he added. The world fleet of LNG tankers currently numbers 123, but will have swollen by about 37 percent by the end of 2004, according to shipping database Fairplay. Gas industry analysts expect some LNG projects to be delayed as a result of the economic downturn, excess capacity at existing plants in Asia and a sharp fall in U.S. natural gas prices this year. Svein Erik Amundsen, Managing Director of Norwegian shipping group Bergesen, said that a sustained economic downturn could have "consequences." "I wouldn't be surprised by project delays," he told Reuters. "This could result in some tonnage coming out of the yards without immediate employment." "I think you can say we're still optimistic, but more cautiously optimistic than before," he added. Bergesen has three new LNG ships on order, two of which have already been contracted out to Belgian gas distributor Distrigas. STOP AND THINK The world's largest and only pure LNG shipping player, Golar LNG, historically bullish in its outlook, has also been forced to stop and consider the problem. Golar has six ships locked into long-term contracts, but four more are under construction at South Korea's Daewoo and Hyundai yards and do not yet have firm future employment. "There is a reasonable balance between the production coming onstream and the amount of ships ordered," Golar Executive VP Sveinung Stohle told Reuters, "The only risk is things might be delayed." Stohle said that contracting out the new ships remained an option, but it was also developing an LNG trading arm, which might have a use for some of them. Golar's closest competitor in terms of size, Exmar, is taking a more traditional approach. It has six ships on order and said it would leave as little as possible to chance. "We've chartered out all of them except the Samsung ship, which is under offer for the (Qatari) RasGas tender," Managing Director Nicolas Saverys told Reuters. Four are booked out to El Paso and one to Enron. He said that until all the upcoming projects had their Supply Production Agreements in place, it would be too risky for companies to place fresh ship orders. "It's a good time to wait," said Saverys.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.WASHINGTON (AP) - General Motors, IBM and Kmart are among corporations that would receive billions of dollars in tax refunds under a $100 billion House Republican economic stimulus package. Democrats say it is far too generous to companies and does too little for individuals. Seven companies would get a total of $3.3 billion in refunds of alternative minimum taxes they paid as far back as 1986. The tax, which the House legislation also would repeal outright, is intended to ensure a basic minimum income tax is paid by companies and individuals that claim numerous deductions and credits.IBM would get a $1.4 billion refund, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, while GM would get $832 million, Kmart $102 million and General Electric $671 million. Others specified for big refunds include energy giant Enron, at $254 million; U.S. Steel, $39 million; and grocery chain Kroger, $9 million. In addition, the study found that Ford Motor Co. would get a refund that could total $2.3 billion, while Chevron's could reach $314 million. Counting repeal of the tax, corporations would get more than $25 billion in tax relief from these minimum tax provisions in 2002 alone. In addition, the bill would make permanent a temporary tax break for financial services firms doing a lot of overseas business, providing them $21 billion in tax relief over 10 years. The generous corporate tax breaks are among the most contentious items in the House GOP measure, scheduled for a floor vote Wednesday. Democrats say the measure is certain to change once it reaches the Senate; the Bush administration also has signaled that $100 billion is too costly. "It's clear the House bill cannot pass the Senate as it is," said Sen. John Breaux, D-La. For individuals, the House legislation includes a new round of tax rebate checks for workers who didn't get them this summer and a cut in the current 27 percent income tax rate to 25 percent in 2002, four years earlier than under the just-enacted tax cut. The measure also reduces capital gains rates from 20 percent to 18 percent for most taxpayers, enhances business equipment write-offs and allows companies to deduct current losses against taxes paid five years earlier. The primary sponsor, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, said in a newspaper opinion piece published Tuesday in USA Today that the legislation "is a shot of adrenaline" that will help restart the economy while not triggering inflation. "Businesses generate jobs, and jobs are the core of a strong economy," wrote Thomas, R-Calif. While bipartisan support backs some of the House items, Senate Democrats have been pushing for expanded unemployment benefits and help for workers who lose health insurance. Sen. Max Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, presented a $70 billion proposal Tuesday that would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks, provide a 50 percent federal match for COBRA health insurance policies and allow more workers to qualify for Medicaid. The legislation also includes rebate checks and some business items similar to the House bill but not the capital gains reduction or the alternative minimum tax relief. Tax cuts in the Baucus measure would total $35 billion in 2002, far below the House GOP level. "This proposal appropriately responds to the sign of the times, helping this nation get back to work and recover quickly," said Baucus, D-Mont. Other Democrats were working on spending programs. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said he was putting together a $20 billion package that included hiring extra customs and border agents and food inspectors, augmented security at nuclear plants and purchase of more vaccines. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said President Bush does not want the stimulus bill laden with additional spending. "Everything in this package needs to be stimulative," Grassley said. "There needs to be more done on the investment side." --- On the Net: House members: http://www.house.gov/house/MemberWWW.htmlCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

"We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between five and 10 percent," John Sherriff, president and CEO of Enron Europe, said in a statement.Enron Metals employees in London were told at a meeting on Tuesday that staff cuts of 10 percent to 20 percent would be required, trade sources said. The company is seeking volunteers to take redundancy, but if sufficient voluntary slots have not been filled by a deadline of October 19, Enron will opt for compulsory cuts, they added. An Enron spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the official statement. "Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth," Sherriff said in the statement. "It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use to ensure that they are deployed in a way which will maximise earnings," he added. Market sources were not surprised by the move, citing testing conditions facing the metals trading sector as a whole. "At the moment you have low volumes of customer interest combined with difficult trading conditions and high operating costs," said one. "Even if they're making money from EnronOnline, they've got far too many people there." U.S.-based Enron Corp became a major player in the metals trade in May last year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals dealing firm in London which had previously absorbed fellow LME ring-dealers Rudolf Wolff & Co and Billiton Metals Ltd. The number of LME ring dealers trading on the exchange's open-outcry floor has dwindled from a peak of 30 in the mid-1980s to the current 12. This could drop to 11 this week if ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia , exits floor trading from Friday. In an interview with Reuters in August, Enron Metals President Joe Gold reiterated the company's commitment to the LME ring. "We send our No 1 trader and No 2 trader down on the (LME) floor every day, which is not a statement everyone can make. Wherever the most trading is during that day, that's where we'll be," Gold said. SCREEN TRADING Enron has also become a major player in metals screen trading since July last year, when the company announced the first physical metals transaction on its internet trading platform EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com). The system differs from the screen trading systems operated by the London Metal Exchange (LME) and UK-based metals and energy broker Spectron in that the trading platform is open to a broad range of users but Enron is the sole counter-party in each transaction. At the end of August the company amended EnronOnline to make markets for selected clients only in three months copper and aluminium for maximum 200-lot transactions, compared with the standard 20-lot markets on the system. In addition to metals, EnronOnline trades a range of products, from oil to plastics and emission allowances to credit derivatives. Enron announced the one millionth transaction on the system in May of this year.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron Plans to Trim as Many as 500 Jobs in Europe (Update2)2001-10-10 16:08 (New York)Enron Plans to Trim as Many as 500 Jobs in Europe (Update2)     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)     Houston, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largestenergy trader, plans to eliminate as many as 500 jobs in Europe,or as much as 10 percent of the workforce there, to reduce costsand boost profit.     The company has 5,000 workers in Europe, and it plans to trimjobs by 5 percent to 10 percent, Enron said in a statement. Thecompany wants to make reductions through ``voluntary severance,''the statement said.     Houston-based Enron expanded European commodities trading in2000 when it bought London-based MG Plc, the largest coppermarketer, for $448 million. Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned asEnron's chief executive in August, told investors in July toexpect ``great things from Europe in the future.''     ``There is still a lot of growth for them in Europe,'' saidLouis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. ``They're notgiving up, they're just taking an analysis of each unit.''Gagliardi doesn't own Enron shares. John S. Herold doesn't issueinvestment recommendations.     Enron Europe is based in London and has offices in nine othercountries. Along with trading, it has interests in power plants inItaly, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the U.K. It didn't say where thejob cuts would be.     Shares of Enron rose $1.81 to $35.20. They have fallen 58percent this year.Northeast Officials Seek Delay In Unifying Power MarketBy Kristen McNamaraOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/10/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Officials in Maryland and New York have urged federal energy regulators to slow down plans to merge the three existing wholesale power markets along the Eastern Seaboard into a single market for the entire Northeast. Citing concerns that rushing to consolidate the markets could create instability, reduce liquidity and inflate prices, the New York Independent System Operator and the Maryland Public Service Commission have separately asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study its plan before implementing it."There's no need to do this in a hasty manner," said Steve Sullivan, spokesman for the New York ISO, which runs that state's power market and transmission system. "Our markets are not broken." FERC is pushing utilities across the country to put their high-voltage transmission systems - the wholesale power market's equivalent of the interstate highway system - under the control of independent regional operators. The commission says the handoff is critical to the establishment of competitive power markets, as utilities with positions in the market are seen as unlikely to allow competitors equal access to the grid. Power traders like Enron Corp. (ENE) support the effort, while some utilities and state regulators have opposed the assertion of federal authority. In an effort to jump-start the sluggish process, FERC has outlined a plan to divide up control of the country's power grids among four regional operators - one each in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and West. But while utilities still control much of the grid elsewhere in the country, transmission systems in the Northeast are already run by three independent wholesale market operators. FERC has told those operators to merge, and has indicated a preference for modeling the new market on that run by Mid-Atlantic operator PJM Interconnection LLC. A unified Northeast power market would be the world's largest - processing $9 billion in energy sales a year, handling 110,000 megawatts of electricity and serving a population of 54 million, according to the New York ISO. Seeking Other Options The Maryland Public Service Commission, along with regulators from Virginia and the District of Columbia, filed motions in August to stay FERC's order, saying the commission had overstepped its authority. The Maryland regulators will ask a federal court to block FERC if it moves forward with its plans to consolidate the three market operators - New York ISO, ISO New England Inc. and PJM - said Robert Harris, the commission's assistant manager of external affairs. The commission last week asked U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski. D-Md., to require FERC to explore options to ease the flow of power between markets short of a forced consolidation. "This proposal is unnecessary, reckless and risky," the PSC wrote. The PSC held public hearings on a unified Northeast power market Oct. 3 and 4, and plans to send the comments it received to FERC next week. The New York ISO and ISO New England said they aren't opposed to a consolidated market, as long as it incorporates the best practices from each of the three existing markets. The New York ISO, along with ISO New England, also wants each of the three regional markets to have equal representation on the board governing the merged market. New York's market operator also questioned whether centralizing control of a Northeast power market with one operator in one location would increase its vulnerability to electronic or other attacks by terrorists. FERC will hold a series of workshops next week to discuss issues related to the development of independent transmission operators across the country, including the need to clear bottlenecks and guard against attempts to manipulate the market. As reported, new FERC Chairman Pat Wood III said the commission will spend a day listening to the concerns of state regulators. The commission has also agreed to study its contention that consolidating markets will pay off for consumers, Wood said. Mirant Corp. (MIR) recently commissioned a study that showed a combined Northeast power market could save consumers $440 million a year. -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

INDIA: Reliance plan could sour BG's Indian deal.By Sriram Ramakrishnan10/10/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.BOMBAY, Oct 10 (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd wants to become the operator of three oil and gas fields off the country's west coast, complicating U.K.-based BG Plc's proposed acquisition of a 30 percent stake in the fields, an industry source told Reuters on Wednesday. Reliance, which owns a 30 percent stake in the fields, has applied to the government to be appointed the operator, said the source, who declined to be identified.That could potentially derail the deal BG announced last week to buy U.S.-based Enron Corp's 30 percent stake in the offshore Indian energy fields for $388 million. Numerous reports in the Indian media have said that the deal may be contingent on operatorship of the fields being transferred from Enron, the current operator, to BG. A spokesman for BG in London said on Wednesday that the company was "continuing discussions with the other parties" and until the matter was resolved, it had no further comment to make. Indian state-run driller ONGC, which owns the remaining 40 percent stake in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields, has already said it wants to take over the operatorship. The source said Reliance Industries, India's leading petrochemicals maker and flagship company of the country's largest business group, is also pursuing management control. Panna, Mukta and Tapti lie off India's western coast, and are considered among the more promising recent finds in the country. Panna and Mukta produce 29,000 barrels of oil and 2.5 million cubic metres of gas per day. The Mukta field produced 1,974 million cubic metres of gas in the year ended March 2001. BG said it wants a stake in the fields to complement its Indian interests in gas distribution and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Enron wants to leave the venture as a part of its move to focus on the high-growth energy trading business.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. USA: El Paso shares advance after favorable ruling.10/10/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A favorable regulatory ruling sent El Paso Corp's undervalued shares soaring on Wednesday, leading the utility group higher in morning trading. After the close of trading Tuesday, a U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission law judge ruled there was no clear evidence that El Paso exercised market power in an attempt to raise California natural gas prices and recommended dismissal of the issue in the case pending before the full commission.This was "not a clean sweep" for the big gas pipeline company, UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said, noting Judge Wagner believes there was affiliate abuse - or collusion - between El Paso's pipeline and marketing segments during California's power crisis late last year and early this year. But Barone believes "the net outcome from his decisions are a substantial positive for El Paso and have significantly reduced the company's limited exposure to this highly politicized California mess." In active morning trading, El Paso shares traded between $51 and $51.69 - their best prices since Sept. 17, the first day of trading following the interruption caused by the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. After two hours, El Paso was up $2.50, or 5.13 percent, to $51.25 on composite trading of 1.8 million shares. Following it higher were the stocks of several other companies that had dropped on news of California's problems - Calpine Corp. , up 4.14 percent; Enron Corp. , up 3.26 percent, and Dynegy Inc. , up 2.4 percent.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

UK: UPDATE 1-ScotiaMocatta seen to axe LME ring trade from Friday.By Martin Hayes10/10/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - London Metal Exchange (LME) ring-dealer ScotiaMocatta Metals is to scale back its operations, and will no longer execute business on the market's open-outcry floor after Friday, trade sources said on Wednesday. ScotiaMocatta is a unit of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia , who informed metal traders of the move at a meeting held yesterday in the LME trader's London offices. Voluntary redundancies were also asked for, sources at the meeting said."They said they are restructuring the business, and will no longer execute trades on the floor after Friday," one said. This implies that ScotiaMocatta, which is one of 12 ring-dealing members (RDMs) on the LME, could relinquish this status, although sources at the meeting said this was not made clear. No-one from ScotiaMocatta in London was available to comment on Wednesday. Separately, Enron Group said its commodities trader Enron Metals would also lose jobs as part of a Europe-wide staff reduction programme. On Tuesday, Bank of Nova Scotia said in Toronto it was scaling back its base metals trading desk and laying off traders, transforming ScotiaMoccata into a "niche player", due to the economic downturn. The bank said the decision does not affect its precious metals division. Bank of Nova Scotia purchased Mocatta Metals as it was known in September 1997. It is also one of the five members of the twice-daily London gold fix - it is the oldest bullion dealing house in the world, dating back to 1671. "We are still staying in the base metals business, but it will be more focused as a niche player in structural products," Scotiabank spokeswoman, Diane Flanagan told Reuters in Toronto. Flanagan confirmed there would be layoffs at the bank's base metals desk, but refused to say how many employees would be affected. If ScotiaMoccatta were to give up RDM status, it would bring LME ring-dealing numbers down to 11. The RDMs are the only firms entitled to trade on the open-outcry floor. In the LME's tiered membership, associate broker clearing members (ABCMs) are the second tier of membership - they have all the rights and privileges of LME membership, but cannot trade during the open-outcry trading sessions. LME director of corporate affairs Jonathan Haslam said on Wednesday that any announcement about a firm's membership status would have to come from the company concerned. DOWNTURN IN METALS BUSINESS HITTING HARD Trading conditions in base metals have deteriorated this year, with prices, volumes and revenues all falling, against a background of a global economic slowdown, worsened by the September 11 attacks on the U.S. This climate has hit all trading companies, and ScotiaMocatta's business has declined markedly, sources said. "They have gone from a position of being on the acquisition front to becoming a niche player. That highlights the way their business has declined in the last six months," a source close to the company said. There had been persistent talk that ScotiaMoccata had been looking to acquire other LME RDMs. In 2000, it sought to buy RDM Rudolf Wolff, a unit of Canada's Noranda. Wolff was eventually purchased by MG Trading, now known as Enron Metals This year it was said to be negotiating to buy another RDM, although that ultimately came to nothing. LME RING DEALING NUMBERS CONTINUE TO FALL LME ring-dealership numbers have declined since the mid-1980s, when there were some 30 companies on the floor. This is partly due to consolidation, but also due to some firms relinquishing their status in the wake of the Sumitomo Corp copper scandal in 1996. Now, there are significantly more ABCMs and the trend towards consolidation and contraction is likely to continue, as their costs are much lower than being a ring-dealer. To run a floor operation, with telecommunications and associated staff charges, probably costs between one and two million stg a year.

LOCALUNDERSEA PIPELINE PLAN FACES SCRUTINY ; HEARING SLATED ON ENRON PLAN TO IMPORT GASDavid Fleshler Staff Writer10/10/2001South Florida Sun-SentinelBroward Metro1B(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)State environmental regulators have raised sharp questions about Enron Corp.'s plans to construct an undersea natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas to South Florida. The pipeline would threaten coral reefs, travel through a popular state park and face a series of hazards in the commercial bustle of Port Everglades, according to a memorandum by the Department of Environmental Protection's southeast district staff.The Houston-based company wants to bring natural gas from a plant in Freeport, Grand Bahama, to Fort Lauderdale. With more gas-fueled power plants in the works, the company thinks it would find a market in Florida. El Paso Corp. and AES Corp. also have proposed undersea pipeline projects, although Enron's Calypso project has moved the furthest in the approval process. Judging from the state's comments on Enron's proposal, all three projects will face difficult questions over their safety and environmental impact. Just before it reaches land, for example, the pipeline would pass through Port Everglades, a busy center of commerce that could be full of peril for a high-pressure gas pipeline. "The pipeline will be routed through an area that has experienced chronic disturbances such as dredging, ship groundings, high ship traffic entering and leaving Port Everglades and storm events," states the memo, prepared by Jayne Bergstrom, an environmental specialist who prepared a series of questions for the company. "Large vessels have caused significant damage to Broward County reefs in recent years, including a 506-foot cargo ship, a freighter driven ashore during a February 1998 storm, a 348-foot Panamanian vessel that washed ashore a month later, and incredibly, a 360-foot nuclear-powered sub, the USS Memphis, in February 1993. Is this the safest route for a high-pressure gas pipeline?" Enron spokesman John Ambler said the pipeline probably would be 30 to 40 feet below the sea floor in the port, well protected even if a ship sank or ran aground directly over it. Just outside the port, the pipeline would ascend to 3 feet below the floor, but that would be in a rocky area that's closed to ships, he said. "We're in the process of developing a response to all of these questions," he said. "We're in an ongoing dialogue, and we're optimistic about being able to resolve these concerns in a way that will allow the project to move forward." The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will conduct a public hearing tonight on the environmental impact of the Enron project. The public will be allowed to make comments or ask questions of the agency's staff. The meeting will be at 7 p.m. at the I.T. Parker Community Center, 901 NE Third St., Dania Beach. As the pipeline approaches Broward County's coastline, it would pass through bands of coral reefs, important habitats for marine life. The company plans to drill horizontally under the reefs to avoid harming them. But it also would drag pipes over them in two areas before inserting them through the holes, according to the state. "Coral reefs deserve protection for their intrinsic natural value," the memo states. "In addition, the economic, tourism, fishing and recreational resources of South Florida depend on healthy coral reef ecosystems. Calypso staff and engineers have not sufficiently demonstrated to staff that the project cannot be redesigned to avoid sensitive marine resources." While the company has stated that the impact would be both temporary and insignificant, the memo states that the company has not explained how this could be so. The state estimated that the project would have an impact on about 15 acres of coral reefs and adjacent habitats. Given the damage the reefs already have suffered from pollution and other sources, the memo questions whether any pipelines should be routed directly to southeast Florida. Instead, it says it may be better to route them to the north, through areas without reefs, then connect to the pipeline system on land. Ambler said that the company was trying to find ways to avoid dragging the pipes along the reefs. All three pipeline projects will be reviewed by a series of federal, state and local agencies.

Reliance Bids to Run Indian Oil Fields, Challenging BG Plan2001-10-10 11:34 (New York)Reliance Bids to Run Indian Oil Fields, Challenging BG Plan     Mumbai, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Reliance Industries Ltd.,India's biggest private company, said it claimed the right to runthree offshore oil and gas projects, challenging a bid from theU.K.'s BG Group Plc.     BG has said a plan to buy out Enron Corp.'s 30 percent of theprojects is contingent on winning the right to oversee thedevelopments. Reliance and Oil & Natural Gas Corp., India'sbiggest oil producer, together own 70 percent of the explorationcompany and have an option to decide the operator after Enronquits, Reliance spokesman Yogesh Desai said.     The purchase would gave BG a 30 percent stake in the Taptiand Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63 percent of anuntapped deposit on the west coast of India. The assets hold morethan 170 million barrels of oil and gas. BG declined to comment.     BG will invest ``hundreds of millions'' of dollars to doubleproduction in the Tapti field by 2004 if the other two partners inthe venture contribute as well, Nigel Shaw, chief executiveofficer of BG India Pvt. told reporters last week. ONGC hasalready claimed its right to operate the fields.     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indianventure partners, ONGS and Reliance, as well as from the nation'sbiggest refiner, Indian Oil Corp.     India's gas production fell 11 percent to 1999 from 1997 asOil & Natural Gas Corp., the state explorer, made no significantdiscoveries in 15 years. Insufficient supplies of gas have hurtgrowth in the country's fertilizer and chemicals industries andhampered upgrading of its power plants, still mostly coal-fed.     The government expects a gas deficit to triple in the nextsix years unless new wells are drilled or existing fields expandsales.     Domestic bureaucracy has already thwarted efforts in India byElectricite de France and Cogetrix Energy Inc., which have pulledout, while Enron is locked in a price dispute with authorities.The government is the sole buyer of gas and power from producersand the sole seller to distributors.LME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)2001-10-10 11:59 (New York)LME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)     (Adds bank quotes in second, fifth paragraphs.)     London, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- The London Metal Exchange saidScotiamocatta, a metals-trading unit of the Bank of Nova Scotia,will cease open-outcry transactions on the LME floor.     It was not immediately clear when the company will end floortrading, said Caoimhe Buckley, a spokeswoman for the exchange, theworld's biggest metals-trading bourse. The bank is planning to cutabout 20 base metals staff in London, said Pam Agnew, aspokeswoman in Toronto, though its floor dealing is unaffected fornow. ``At this time, it's business as usual,'' she said.     Scotiamocatta is the latest defection from the LME, whosenumber of floor traders has more than halved to 11 in the pastdecade because of declining margins. This year, the price ofcopper has dropped 23 percent and aluminum has declined 17 percentas slowing economies cut demand and reduce trading commissions.     ``It detracts from (the LME's) standing as a marketplacebecause it's another one gone,'' said Richard Starsmeare, head ofcommodity and trade finance at Raiffeisen Zentralbank in London.     The bank's decision to cut its London metals staff is relatedto the ``downturn in the economy,'' Agnew said.     The LME's director of corporate affairs, Jonathan Haslam,later said the exchange couldn't officially comment onScotiamocatta's role at the exchange.     ``The LME wishes to make clear that it has made no formalstatement about the position of the Bank of Nova Scotia,'' Haslamsaid in a statement. ``Any statements about their future tradingmust come from them.''     The LME's other floor-trading members, or ``ring dealers''include Enron Metals Ltd. and Refco Overseas Ltd.Bin Laden 'look alike' arrested in IndiaBBC NewsOctober 9, 2001By Frances Harrison in Delhi Indian police detained a bearded man in the western border area of Rajasthan on suspicion that he might be the world's most wanted man, Osama Bin Laden. The man was released after two hours of questioning which established that he was in fact a Hindu and also worked for an American company. Police in the town of Jaisalmer bordering Pakistan said they saw a man with a flowing beard and black scarf driving along the national highway in a jeep. They chased the man, took him to the police station and politely asked who he was - clearly concerned they might have apprehended Osama Bin Laden fleeing Aghanistan via Pakistan. US company The bearded man told the police he was an engineer working with the American company Enron on a wind energy project in the area. A telephone call to the company confirmed this and one policeman told the man that he should be thankful he wasn't living in the United States because he would have definitely been shot so strong was his resemblance to Osama Bin Laden. The man, who turned out to be a Hindu and not a Muslim, was freed immediately. But not before a crowd of curious villagers had gathered outside the police station eager to catch a glimpse of the man who's been dominating the news. 
to meet : USA: UPDATE 1-Energy casts some light in gloomy profit season.Reuters English News Service, 10/16/01USA: Energy permits some light in gloomy profit season.Reuters English News Service, 10/16/01USA: INTERVIEW-Enron says may partner or sell broadband business.Reuters English News Service, 10/16/01USA: UPDATE 6-Enron posts loss after taking $1 bln in charges.Reuters English News Service, 10/16/01Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)Bloomberg, 10/16/01USA: UPDATE 1-Energy casts some light in gloomy profit season.By Per Jebsen10/16/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy and mining companies have provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third-quarter results on Monday and Tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years. Technology bellwethers Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which reported sharply lower profits, did little to buck the downward trend.FirstEnergy Corp. , an owner of electric utilities in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 18 percent increase in earnings, citing increased electricity sales and lower costs. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. reported a third-quarter profit that reversed a year-earlier loss, due to higher gold production. Yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule. Top chipmaker Intel said on Tuesday after the close of exchanges that profits tumbled 77 percent as it suffered from slowing global economies and weak personal computer sales. PC maker IBM announced its first quarterly earnings decline since the end of 1999 as weak sales continued to weigh on profits. Energy giant Enron Corp. posted a quarterly loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges. Companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls, including Caterpillar Inc. , the world's largest maker of construction equipment, and Unisys Corp. , a computer company. "The earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly, and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point," said Michael Holland, who runs the $65 million Holland Balanced Fund. FOCUS NOT ON EARNINGS "The focus (for investors) has been and continues to be outside of earnings, that is, the war on terrorism specifically," he said. Dynegy Inc. , a natural gas and power marketer and trader, on Monday said third-quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business. "Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down," said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. "These are good, well-financed companies." Caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing. The company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels. Unisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook. TAKING GRIM TIDINGS IN STRIDE Other companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc. , a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp. , the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead. Money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride. "Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks," said Burnham. "Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months." "Whatever earnings are in this quarter isn't going to matter too much, except in cases where they're considerably better than expected or worse," he said. This week is the busiest for earnings with 15 Dow Jones industrial average and 180 Standard & Poor's 500 Index companies scheduled to report. Profits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22.8 percent, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial, making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991. That's down from an expected 6.2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter, and a 14.7 percent drop expected on Sept. 10, said First Call analyst Joe Cooper. Some 85 S&P 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results.

USA: Energy permits some light in gloomy profit season.By Per Jebsen10/16/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy and mining companies provided a few glimmers of light but otherwise third-quarter results on Monday and Tuesday are helping to fulfill expectations for the worst quarter in 10 years. FirstEnergy Corp., an owner of electric utilities in northern Ohio and western Pennsylvania, on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected 18 percent increase in earnings, citing increased electricity sales and lower costs. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. reported a third-quarter profit that reversed a year-earlier loss, due to higher gold production.Yet such good news is proving more the exception than the rule. Energy giant Enron Corp..ENE) posted a quarterly loss after taking $1.01 billion in charges. Companies from a range of industries reported profit shortfalls, including Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest maker of construction equipment, and Unisys Corp., a computer company. "The earnings season is one that the market has digested and in some cases predigested as being just ugly, and therefore horrible or ugly results are not met with surprise at this point," said Michael Holland, who runs the $65 million Holland Balanced Fund. "The focus (for investors) has been and continues to be outside of earnings, that is, the war on terrorism specifically," he said. Investors are likely to pay attention to the earnings reports from tech bellwethers International Business Machines Corp., a computer maker, and chipmaker Intel Corp.. These are scheduled to be released on Tuesday after the close of trading. Dynegy Inc., a natural gas and power marketer and trader, on Monday said third-quarter earnings rose 62 percent as its backbone wholesale energy business nearly doubled its returns. While Enron posted a loss, it reported that its profit excluding charges rose 35 percent due to strong performance in its core energy business. "Energy companies manage to earn pretty good money even when prices are down," said Jon Burnham, portfolio manager for the $170 million Burnham Fund. "These are good, well-financed companies." Caterpillar helped to lead a litany of earnings woes. The Peoria, Illinois-based company on Tuesday said its third-quarter earnings fell 5 percent because of higher expenses and less efficient manufacturing. The company also said it expects fourth-quarter revenues to be down slightly from the year-ago quarter, with full-year profit down 10 percent to 15 percent. It blamed economic uncertainty in the wake of last month's attacks for the expected shortfall, but added that 2002 sales will be at least flat to up slightly from 2001 levels. Unisys on Monday reported its third-quarter profits plunged by 50 percent due to weakening demand for high-end server computers and systems integration work. It said it would cut 3,000 jobs and slashed its fourth-quarter outlook. Other companies that have reported profit drops include Novellus Systems Inc., a maker of semiconductor production equipment, and Charles Schwab Corp., the top U.S. discount brokerage. Schwab said Tuesday that quarterly earnings fell 51 percent as customers avoided stocks all summer, although a surge in September trading pointed to better times ahead. Money managers are taking the grim profit tidings in stride. "Most of these earnings situations are in these stocks," said Burnham. "Barring unforeseens in the national and international situation, the market should work its way higher over the next 6 to 9 months." "Whatever earnings are in this quarter isn't going to matter too much, except in cases where they're considerably better than expected or worse," he said. This week is the busiest for earnings with 15 Dow Jones industrial average and 180 Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX) companies scheduled to report. Profits for the companies in the index are expected to shrink by 22.8 percent, according to market research firm First Call/Thomson Financial, making it the worst quarter since the second quarter of 1991. That's down from an expected 6.2 percent decline at the beginning of the quarter, and a 14.7 percent drop expected on Sept. 10, said First Call analyst Joe Cooper. Some 85 S&P 500 companies so far have reported quarterly results. Of these, 50 companies have beaten the most recent, often lowered Wall Street expectations while 26 have matched and nine have missed forecasts.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: INTERVIEW-Enron says may partner or sell broadband business.10/16/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.HOUSTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Energy giant Enron Corp. said on Tuesday it is reviewing strategic options for its loss-making broadband telecommunications business, which could involve selling the business or finding a partner. "In addition to us looking at our business on a standalone business, we clearly have entertained some discussions on other possibilities," Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay told Reuters in a telephone interview.Earlier on Tuesday, Enron reported that one-time charges of $1.01 billion for broadband and other businesses outside its core energy operations pushed the company to a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, its first quarterly loss in more than four years. Future options for the broadband business include "sale, partnership, all kinds of possibilities" he said. "We still think over time that it will be a valuable business," Lay said, but for now the broadband market is in a "total meltdown", he added. Enron's broadband unit, which owns an 18,000 mile network, posted a loss of $80 million for the third quarter, but Lay said losses should be smaller in subsequent quarters. Enron launched its broadband business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential and has scaled down its operations. Enron's stock rose by 87 percent last year, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of the EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. But the stock has fallen some 59 percent so far this year as sentiment toward the broadband project soured, CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after only six months in the job and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. Enron shares on Tuesday closed up 67 cents, or 2.02 percent, at $33.84.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. USA: UPDATE 6-Enron posts loss after taking $1 bln in charges.By C. Bryson Hull10/16/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.WASHINGTON, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. on Tuesday reported its first loss in more than four years after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments, including water and telecommunications services, which it said have clouded the strength of its core energy businesses. Enron, North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas and power, said the charges were an attempt to put its house in order after a tumultuous year in which a new chief executive suddenly resigned and the company's stock lost two-thirds of its value as once enthusiastic investors lost faith in the company."What we've tried to do here is clean up anything that we thought needed cleaning up to get these distractions out of the way," Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay said in a conference call. Lay reassumed the CEO mantle at Enron after his successor, Jeff Skilling, resigned in August after only six months at the helm. Houston-based Enron reported a third-quarter net loss of $638 million, or 84 cents a share, compared with net income of $271 million, or 34 cents a share, in the same period of 2000. It was Enron's first loss since the second quarter of 1997. The charges covered the company's loss-making broadband telecommunications business, its troubled water affiliate Azurix, and New Power Co., Enron's retail electricity joint-venture with AOL/Time Warner and IBM. Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade said it would probably take Enron a few more quarters to rebuild confidence in the company which was a Wall Street favorite just 12 months ago. "They do a couple of things very well and if they stick to their knitting, they're a solid company, but they have stumbled when they strayed further afield," said Meade. Enron's stock closed 67 cents higher at $33.84 on Tuesday, but for the year it is down about 59 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index .SPU), which has fallen some 23 percent over the same period. ILL-FATED BUSINESSES Originally a natural gas pipeline operator, Enron seized on opportunities created by the deregulation of U.S. energy markets to become the nation's dominant wholesale marketer and trader of natural gas and electricity. The company moved into the water services business in 1998 by acquiring Britain's Wessex Water and forming Azurix, a unit which Enron took public in 1999 but had to buy back this year after it failed to meet performance targets and its stock price tumbled. Enron helped set up New Power Co. and take it public last year but its stock has since fallen from about $28 per share to less than $2 as companies have found it hard to make a profit in deregulated U.S. residential electricity markets. Enron also launched a broadband telecommunications business last year, predicting that network capacity would one day be traded like natural gas or electricity, but it has recently admitted that it overestimated the market's early potential. Enron's stock soared past sector peers last year when it posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. But the stock has fallen sharply this year as broadband sentiment soured, Skilling resigned and wrangling continued over Enron's stalled Dabhol power plan project in India. Enron's third-quarter earnings before one-time charges rose to $393 million, or 43 cents a share, from $292 million, or 34 cents a share, meeting analysts' expectations of 42 to 45 cents a share, according to Thomson Financial/First Call. The company reaffirmed its previously stated earnings targets of 45 cents a share for the fourth quarter, $1.80 for all of 2001 and $2.15 for all of 2002. DEBT ON CREDIT REVIEW Rating agency Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday said it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. The writedowns would reduce Enron's equity base, increase its nominal financial leverage and materially impact its earnings, Moody's said. Enron's third-quarter earnings report showed that income at its wholesale marketing and trading division, the company's backbone moneymaker, grew 28 percent. The division, which deals primarily in electricity and natural gas, saw pretax income rise to $754 million from $589 million in the third quarter of 2000. All of the income growth in the segment came from Enron's gas and power trading and marketing operations in the Americas, where income grew to $701 million from $536 million last year. The European segment, which includes gas and power operations there and other commodity sales like metals, coal and crude oil, remained flat at $53 million amid lower volatility. The latest earnings report marked the first time that Enron has provided a financial breakdown of the European and Americas wholesale operations. In doing so, Lay delivered on a promise he made after Skilling's departure: that he would make Enron's financial reporting more transparent. Many analysts and investors had grumbled about a lack of clarity from Enron.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)2001-10-16 16:29 (New York)Enron Has Third-Quarter Loss After Expansion Fails (Update9)     (Adds in sixth paragraph that losses are equal to 70 percentof Enron's profits over the last four quarters. Closes shares.)     Houston, Oct. 16 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largestenergy trader, had a $618 million loss in the third quarter afterexpansion into water, telecommunications and retail-energy salescost the company $1.01 billion.     The loss was 84 cents a share after payment of preferreddividends, Enron said. Net income a year earlier was $292 million,or 34 cents. Revenue rose 59 percent to $47.6 billion.     Investors have sent Enron stock down 60 percent this year onconcern about investments outside energy trading and natural-gaspipelines. Some investors praised Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairmanand chief executive officer, for acknowledging the failure of thenew businesses. Others said they're not confident all the bad newsis out.     ``What is disconcerting is that they didn't do this sooner,''said Donald Coxe, manager of the $352 million Harris InsightEquity Fund. ``If you kill one cockroach in the kitchen, itdoesn't mean there aren't more.''     Investors have questioned Enron's financial reporting in thepast year, especially after Jeffrey Skilling's resignation as CEOin August. Skilling, who helped Lay transform Enron from a gas-pipeline company into the top competitor in energy trading, saidhe left for personal reasons. Investors said they weren'tconfident Enron was detailing all its problems.                         Failed Businesses     The $1.01 billion in losses, which total $1.11 a share, areequal to 70 percent of Enron's $1.45 billion in profits over thepast four quarters.     Included were $544 million for losses on investments in NewPower Co., a venture formed with AOL Time Warner Inc. andInternational Business Machines Corp. New Power competes forenergy sales in states that allow consumers to choose power andgas suppliers as they do long-distance phone companies.     The $544 million also includes losses from the Enron unitthat trades space, known as bandwidth, on fiber-optic networks, aswell as for the ``early termination of certain structured financearrangements'' with an undisclosed ``entity.'' Enron wouldn't bemore specific.     Enron said restructuring the fiber-optic unit would costanother $180 million, including severance pay to 500 firedworkers. The business collapsed this year along with the fortunesof the dot-com companies that were expected to be some off itsbiggest customers.     The declining value of assets owned by Azurix Corp., itswater and sewage treatment business, will cost $287 million, Enronsaid.     Enron might take a first-quarter ``adjustment'' of less than$200 million because of accounting changes related to goodwill,Lay said in an interview. ``If we thought there were any othersignificant concerns, we would have taken care of them today,''Lay said.                         Excluding Losses     Minus the losses, Enron would have earned $393 million, or 43cents a share, up 35 percent from the year-earlier period. Thatmatched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by ThomsonFinancial/First Call.     Enron has averaged quarterly profit increases of 31 percentfor the past year. Its wholesale services business, which includesenergy trading, had income before interest, minority interests andtaxes of $754 million, up 28 percent from a year earlier.     Shares of Enron rose 67 cents to $33.84. Earlier, the stockhad risen as much as 5.2 percent to $34.90.     ``There's a sigh of relief that Enron's core businesses, itsenergy merchant businesses, are OK,'' said Roger Hamilton, whohelps manage John Hancock's Value funds, which own 600,000 shares.     Enron said it still expects to earn 45 cents a share in thefourth quarter, $1.80 for the full year and $2.15 in 2002.                     `Ridiculous Investments'     At one time, Enron pinned high hopes on the businesses thatcontributed to the $1.01 billion in losses.     Enron spent $2.8 billion in 1998 for the U.K.'s Wessex Water,from which Azurix emerged. Enron sold shares to the public in1999, and then bought back the company this year after Azurixfailed in its strategy of buying up water companies and winninglarge projects. In August, Enron agreed to sell Azurix's NorthAmerican business to American Water Works Inc. for $150 million.     In February 2000, Lay said trading bandwidth could become thecompany's fastest-growing business. In the latest quarter, thebandwidth unit's loss before interest, minority interests andtaxes widened to $80 million from $20 million a year earlier.Revenue plunged to $4 million from $162 million.     ``You can make the case that Jeff Skilling leaving was forthe best,'' John Hancock's Hamilton said. ``Under him, they builtthe best trading operation while also making all these ridiculousinvestments.''     While admitting its poor choices, Enron also supplied moreinformation this quarter about how it makes money. The companygave results of individual commodity-trading desks, includingcoal, forest products and steel.     ``I liked that they broke out the different commodities,''Hamilton said. ``I think Lay has gotten the message loud andclear, and that the effort is there.''

The Marlin II notes and the Osprey notesare currently rated `BBB'. This rating action follows theplacing of Enron Corp.'s ratings on Rating Watch Negative byFitch.The rating of the Marlin II notes is supported by an overfundaccount (pre-funded interest) and equity commitment from Enronin the form of mandatorily convertible preferred stock. Theoverfund account is invested in Enron debt securities (rated'BBB+', Rating Watch Negative), with payments used to serviceinterest to noteholders. Payment of principal ultimately relieson Enron's obligation to remarket mandatorily convertiblepreferred securities. Fitch currently rates Enron's preferredsecurities 'BBB-', Rating Watch Negative. In addition, thetransaction also benefits from rights under a $125 million loanto Azurix Europe Limited, rated `BBB+' by Fitch.Similarly, the rating of the Osprey I notes is based on thesupport from the assets in the share trust used to supportinterest payments and an equity commitment from Enron toremarket mandatorily convertible preferred stock to fundprincipal payments. The mandatorily convertible preferred stockhas been issued and is being held in the share trust. The assetsin the share trust supporting interest payments include Enronunsecured obligations (the overfund account) as well asquarterly dividend payments on the mandatorily convertiblepreferred stock.While various sources of repayment exist, such as sale orliquidation of the underlying assets or an equity offering, ineach case primary credit support is derived from the Enronobligation to remarket mandatorily convertible preferred stockif an amount sufficient to repay the notes has not beendeposited with the trustee the 120-day prior to the maturitydate, which is one of the Note Trigger Events.

Late Thursday, Enron said it had taken action to dispel uncertainty in the financial community. Specifically, the company said it drew on its committed lines of credit to provide cash liquidity in excess of $1 billion.Enron's 6.4% bonds which come due in July 2006 were hovering just below 80 cents on the dollar, down from around 82 cents on Thursday. Trading activity in investment-grade bank debt like that of Enron's isn't as active as the market for leveraged loans made to companies with less than investment-grade ratings. But fixed-income sources noted some offers Friday for Enron's bank debt at around 94 cents on the dollar, still well-above distressed levels. They add that banks may want to try to sell Enron's bank debt, which is now funded following the drawdown, but at a coupon that was negotiated several months ago. That was well before Enron ran into its current market turmoil. Last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss and $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The company has said that the Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an inquiry into transactions it did with Andrew S. Fastow, its former chief financial officer who was replaced on Wednesday. Moody's Investors Service rates Enron's senior unsecured debt at Baa1, though it's on review for a possible downgrade. Fitch Inc. and Standard & Poor's both rate the debt triple-B-plus. Fitch also has Enron's debt on review for a possible downgrade, while S&P changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Enron's stock was trading at around $15.87, down 48 cents at around 12.20 p.m. EDT. Among the Enron bank debt that comes due in May 2002 is a $1.75 billion 364-day commercial paper backstop facility. The company also has a $1.25 billion revolving facility that's due in April 2005, according to Loan Pricing Corp. in New York. One distressed debt investor said some of the bank debt comes with a low coupon of around 55 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. Banks, the investor said, "are funding it and not getting paid for the risk at Libor plus 55, even though it comes due in May '02," the investor said. Another fixed-income official said that trading desks may start to kick the tires on Enron's bank debt, given the run of fallen angels, or investment-grade companies that have been downgraded to below investment-grade status, within the last year. Among such companies are Lucent Technologies Inc. (LU) and Xerox Corp. (XRX) "As soon as banks have a piece of paper they never expected to be funded, it really changes their perception and some just want to get this stuff off their books," this person said. Some banks, though, may not be active seller of Enron's debt given that banks' business with big investment-grade companies is relationship-driven. "Banks are not very quick to pull out of a relationship like that," the fixed income official said. -By Joe Niedzielski, Dow Jones Newswires, 201-938-2039; joe.niedzielski@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Sues Microsoft Over Failed Broadband Services DealBy Michael RiekeOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/26/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- In a July conference call with analysts when Jeff Skilling was still chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE), he threw out a ray of hope for his company's foundering broadband business. Enron Broadband Services had just signed a long-term deal to provide bandwidth for MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s (MSFT) online Internet service, Skilling said. Enron would give more details on the deal later.After three months without farther word on the deal, Enron has broken its silence by suing Microsoft. In a suit filed Thursday in the district court of Harris County, Texas, Enron claimed Microsoft has failed to live up to terms of the deal. The agreement, signed June 25, called for Enron Broadband to develop and provide network capacity and other services to support Microsoft's offering of high-speed Internet service, according to the lawsuit. Microsoft was required to develop an electronic ordering and billing system for use with all regional Bell telephone companies during an initial phase of the deal, according to the lawsuit. Microsoft has failed to provide that system and other items required in the deal, so Enron isn't required to deliver operational broadband services for the deal, the lawsuit said. Microsoft sent Enron a letter dated Oct. 23 saying that if Enron didn't provide an operational broadband system by Oct. 25, Enron would have breached the contract, the lawsuit said. Microsoft then would be entitled to recover damages. The suit also said Microsoft failed to provide monthly subscriber growth forecast required by the deal. In a third breach of the contract, the suit claimed, Microsoft made public announcements about the subject of the agreement without getting Enron's prior approval. An Enron official told Dow Jones Newswires that Microsoft had issued a press release Oct. 15 about the service but that Enron wasn't mentioned in the release. A Microsoft news release dated Oct. 15 announced what the company calls MSN 7, a new version of the MSN network which includes high-speed, or broadband, access to the Web. The service was to be available on Oct. 25. The Microsoft release said MSN 7 would deliver "state-of-the-art" video and audio through "dramatically improved" broadband technology. The new service would extend MSN broadband service "to more than 29 million households in 45 markets." By the end of the first quarter of 2002, the Microsoft release said, the MSN broadband service would be available to more than 90% of U.S. households capable of using high-speed digital subscriber line access. The Enron lawsuit asked that Microsoft be declared in breach of contract. It also asked that Enron be allowed to recover unspecified damages as well as costs stemming from the lawsuit. Neither Enron nor Microsoft have responded to requests for comment on the lawsuit. The Microsoft deal is the second failed broadband agreement. In July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video, a unit of Viacom Inc. (VIA), announced a deal to deliver movies over the Internet. That deal fell apart in March of this year when Blockbuster said Enron's fiber-optic network couldn't deliver the service on a dependable basis. Enron countered that Blockbuster couldn't deliver the quality and quantity of movies needed for a successful video-on-demand service. -By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; michael.rieke@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

BusinessENRON UNIT TAKES HEAT POWER GROUP SAYS ENERGY FIRM FAILED BOND REQUIREMENTSJeffrey Krasner, Globe Staff10/26/2001The Boston GlobeTHIRDC.1(Copyright 2001)The retail sales subsidiary of Houston energy giant Enron Corp. faced expulsion last week from the New England group representing power generators, marketers and distributors. The sales unit had failed to meet bonding requirements intended to protect market participants and the group itself from unpaid bills. ISO New England, which operates the power grid throughout the six New England states, urged Nepool, the power industry group, to "initiate termination proceedings" for Enron Energy Services Inc., according to a letter obtained by the Globe.An Enron spokeswoman yesterday said the company had satisfied Nepool's requirements, and blamed the threatening letter on a series of administrative oversights, including the failure of ISO New England to warn Enron of previous instances when the bond fell below required levels. "It was an administrative snafu," said Peggy Mahoney, a spokeswoman for Enron. "It's fixed. It's no big deal. We didn't get the paperwork in [on time] because it got sent to the wrong desk. It was taken care of on Friday." According to the letter, a Nepool participant faces termination if it has failed to meet its bonding requirements three times over the previous 12 months. "Having three defaults to trigger that letter does not happen frequently," said Ellen Foley, an ISO New England spokeswoman. In the letter, ISO's chief financial officer, Edward McKenna, said his organization "has been in contact with Enron Energy Services through multiple telephone communications, and to date the financial assurance has not been cured." But Mahoney said Enron never received written notification of its previous "financial assurance" defaults, which were corrected almost immediately. Therefore, she said, the company was unaware that the current default was the third, which begins the expulsion proceeding. In addition, she said, the current default notice was sent to the wrong person, creating the delay that resulted in the letter. "We're working with ISO New England to figure that out," she said. The recommended termination is an embarrassment to Enron because the firm's director of state government affairs, Daniel W. Allegretti, is the chairman of Nepool's Participant Committee, which organizes and oversees the major membership meetings in the organization. "This is not that unusual within the pool," said Allegretti. "I frequently receive notices of technical defaults." As far as posting the new bond to correct the situation, he said, "We were two and a half days late in submitting paperwork." The incident also comes at a particularly sensitive time for Enron. The parent in Houston has been the subject of a financial scandal in which the firm's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, is accused of profiting from partnerships he oversaw that engaged in billions of dollars of transactions with Enron. The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing those transactions, the company said Monday. Enron placed Fastow on leave Tuesday and installed a new CFO. Enron's stock has plunged amid ongoing revelations about the partnerships and their impact on the company's financial strength. The company reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion after terminating transactions by one of the partnerships that had been headed by Fastow, according to The Wall Street Journal.

FRONT PAGE - COMPANIES & MARKETS: Enron's explanations fail to quell critics' concerns Financial Times; Oct 26, 2001By JULIE EARLE and SHEILA MCNULTYEnron has put up a page on its website of "frequently asked questions" in response to a barrage of analysts' enquiries following last week's controversial results announcement. Unfortunately, the US energy group's critics have not been satisfied with the answers. Nor has Wednesday's decision to replace Andrew Fastow, its chief financial officer, quelled all investors' concerns about its highly complex financial affairs. However, analysts are pleased that Kenneth Lay, chief executive officer, is distancing the group from Mr Fastow and his ties to controversial financing vehicle "partnerships". "It is a step in the right direction and we are happy to see them move," says Ronald Barone of UBS Warburg. "It's not the end of it." The shares, which have tumbled since last week's results, ended a shade lower yesterday, off 0.37 per cent at Dollars 16.35. But analysts warn that the shares will continue to languish well below the 52-week high of Dollars 84.87 until the group improves its transparency. One of the frequently asked questions following Enron's results announcement on October 16 concerned "a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 840m) reduction in shareholders' equity". The Dollars 1.2bn was not explained in the news release on the results, but mentioned in passing by Mr Lay in a follow-up conference call. Many analysts confused it with a Dollars 1.01bn charge in the earnings report. It has since been called a "loss" and a "write-off" and Enron's staff have struggled to explain it in plain language. Enron's official position now is that the reduction in shareholders' equity related to a structured finance vehicle in which LJM, a private equity fund formed by Mr Fastow, was an investor. When the decision was made to terminate these vehicles, Enron "recorded a Dollars 1.2bn reduction in shareholders' equity and a corresponding reduction in receivables. These adjustments were the result of Enron's termination of obligations to deliver Enron shares in future periods". The confusion over the Dollars 1.2bn has further undermined the credibility of Enron, which is now the subject of an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Analysts were upset they did not know the adjustment was in the offing and note that it could be seen as increasing the group's debt ratio, which might hurt its debt rating. Mr Lay held an analysts' meeting to counter charges that Enron was not transparent. But this ended with demands for daily calls with outside auditors to explain its accounts. "I find the disclosure is not complete enough for me to understand and explain all the intricacies of these transactions," said Goldman Sachs' David Fleischer. Other analysts are also concerned about potential further write-offs. Salomon Smith Barney's Raymond Niles points to Enron's investments in its Dabhol Indian power plant, its South American investments, and its remaining telecoms assets. Most importantly, he says, they may include several of Enron's other off-balance-sheet vehicles. "Frankly, we have not been able to get enough information on them to evaluate whether there is a problem with them," Mr Niles says. Other US energy traders have been distancing themselves from their rival. El Paso said it was facing "a lot of questions on its accounting practices".

Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. bonds and sharesfell after the company failed to reassure investors its bondrating wouldn't be lowered and tapped a $3 billion credit linebecause it can no longer borrow in the commercial paper markets.     Enron's stock has fallen 52 percent in the past 10 days afterinvestors questioned the company's transactions with affiliatedcompanies run by its former chief financial officer. The stockfell 45 cents to $15.90 in early afternoon trading today.     ``People are questioning the credibility of management,''said John Cassady, who helps manage $3 billion of fixed incomeassets at Fifth Third Bancorp. ``It looks like the guy who wassupposed to do everything for the benefit of shareholders wasrunning partnerships for the benefit of himself.''     Enron is shut out of commercial paper markets, where short-term loans carry lower rates than banks offer. The company willuse its credit line to pay off $2.2 billion in commercial paper ithas outstanding, Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said.      The company's 6 3/4 percent bonds which mature in 2009declined 1 1/2 points to a bid of 84 cents on the dollar and anoffer of 86 cents. At that price, the bonds, which carry a ratingof ``BBB+,'' yield 9.53 percent.     Enron's shares have dropped as investors grew concerned thatthe company's credit rating will be cut after $1.01 billion inthird-quarter losses from failed investments. Enron needs goodcredit to raise cash daily to keep trading partners from demandingcollateral and to settle transactions.                         Dilution Concerns     Though Enron's bonds have investment-grade ratings, theiryield at current prices is higher than those of industrial bondsthat carry junk ratings. According to Bloomberg data, companieswith ``BB'' ratings pay on average 9.16 percent to borrow forseven years.     A lower credit rating may also force Enron to buy backholdings in other partnerships with its stock, diluting the valueof Enron investors' stock.     Partnerships called Whitewing, Marlin and Yosemite own Enronassets they bought with borrowed money. Enron sold the assets tothe partnerships to keep debt related to them off its books. Thepartnerships plan to repay the borrowed money by selling theassets.     If Enron loses investment-grade rating, the borrowed moneycomes due earlier, leaving less time for the partnerships to findthe best price for the power plants and other assets. Enron wouldhave to make up any shortfall between what the assets would sellfor and the amount of the debt.     One way would be issuing common shares in exchange for Enronpreferred convertible shares held by the partnerships. That wouldthin out the holding of every other investor.     Of the two main bond rating companies, Moody's InvestorsService has the company on watch for possible downgrade, andStandard & Poor's lowered Enron's long-term credit outlook tonegative. Egan-Jones Rating Co. today lowered its rating onEnron's debt to BB+, one notch below investment grade, from BBB-.                         Other Liabilities     Enron's liabilities associated with the partnerships amountsto at least $3.3 billion, the company has said.     Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow onWednesday amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into apartnership he ran that cost the company $35 million in directlosses. Enron also bought back 62 million shares from thepartnership, reducing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.

Tata Power has written to the Indian government expressing interest in the plant, though any deal would have to address the high tariff structure and interest rate burden on the project, the newspaper said.It is understood that Enron is considering an offer price of about 80 cents to the dollar, it said. Enron declined on Friday to confirm it was in talks with Tata, but said the best solution would be for the Indian government, or one of its Indian financial backers, to take on Dabhol. Tata Power recently held talks with Indian financial institutions involved with the project. Officials from Dabhol Power Company, Enron's Indian arm, also attended. About 70 pct of the Dabhol plant was funded by debt, with Indian financial institutions providing 1.4 bln usd and foreign lenders the balance. Enron's Indian unit defaulted in September on interest payments to international lenders, blaming stopped payments by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the plant's sole client. tb/pb For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Qatar, Dolphin to sign final mega gas deal "shortly"10/14/2001Agence France-Presse(Copyright 2001)ABU DHABI, Oct 14 (AFP) - Qatar and Dolphin Energy will sign the final development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) for a multi- billion-dollar project to deliver Qatari gas abroad "shortly", the UAE Offsets Group (UOG) said Sunday. "The development and production sharing agreement (DPSA) with Qatar Petroleum (QP) is due to be signed shortly," UOG said in a statement.The state-run UOG added that Dolphin Energy will select by early next year an oil major to become a strategic partner in the project. "Over the coming weeks, the international oil companies will be given additional data and invited to submit their offers by late December. One of them is scheduled to be selected in early 2002," UOG said. UOG held separate negotiations last week with five shortlisted oil majors -- Conoco, ExxonMobil and Occidental Petroleum of the United States, BP International and the Anglo-Dutch firm Shell -- to replace the US firm Enron Corp., which withdrew from the venture in May and transferred its 24.5 percent stake to UOG. Enron's role was to build a 350-kilometre (220-mile) pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi. The Dolphin project aims to create a regional grid taking gas from Qatar to Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Oman and eventually Pakistan. In a project estimated at an overall cost of up to 10 billion dollars, the gas is to be transported by undersea pipeline from Qatar to the Abu Dhabi coast. The gas will be distributed inside Abu Dhabi and neighbouring Dubai through existing networks and will be transported between the two through a pipeline for which technical bids have already been submitted. The pipeline will then continue overland to Oman and from there to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline. The extension to Pakistan is expected to cost up to an additional three billion dollars. lp/dabCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESS & TECHNOLOGYNATURAL GAS BIG IN STATE'S FUTURE > NEW PIPELINES ARE PROPOSED TO FILL NEEDSAntonio Fins Business Writer10/14/2001South Florida Sun-SentinelBroward Metro1H(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)Prodded by rules requiring cleaner air and bolstered by a series of competing pipeline proposals, natural gas is set to become a major player in Florida's energy grid. The state Public Service Commission projects that by the end of the decade, natural gas will account for 44 percent of the fuel used by Florida utilities, up from about 18 percent now. Utility companies use 85 percent of the natural gas burned in Florida.As energy companies bid for the right to drill for oil and gas 100 miles off Florida's coast, other businesses are betting big dollars on natural gas. Gulfstream Natural Gas System is already building a pipeline from Mississippi and Alabama across the Gulf of Mexico and into the Tampa area. Enron Corp. of Houston is proposing to spend as much as $400 million to build a pipeline from the Bahamas Port Everglades. Enron's proposal is drawing rivals. El Paso Corp., also in Houston, wants to build a Bahamas to South Florida pipeline that comes ashore in West Palm Beach. And AES Corp. has purchased Ocean Cay, a speck of an island near Bimini in the Bahamas for an energy complex that will include a power plant and a gas pipeline to Port Everglades. The proposals are receiving scrutiny from county officials and environmental groups. Ultimately, federal regulators must give their approval before a pipeline can be constructed. Still, electric companies, which are proposing to build more than 80 new power plants in Florida through 2010, are looking to make heavy use of natural gas. "Practically all the new units are going to burn natural gas," said Michael Haff, an engineer at the PSC. "That's the reason for the large increase" in projections of natural gas usage. All this is quite a change for Florida's electric utilities. For decades, power suppliers have found it easier to cart coal and ship oil to burn in Florida's power plants than to pipe in natural gas. Nor has there been much of a popular mandate for natural gas in Florida. Most users are small factories, public laundries and restaurants, where chefs prefer natural gas over electricity because it's easier to control the heat. With little need for heating homes in winter, residential use has generally been limited to barbecues, water heaters and stoves. Consequently, Florida uses far less natural gas than many states. Household use of natural gas is less than one-fifth of what some households in other parts of the country use. The motive for the switch comes from a combination of factors. The federal Clean Air act, signed into law in 1990, is forcing utilities across the country to reduce their dependence on coal and oil and to find cleaner sources of fuel to power their generators. Natural gas is one of those options. Alvaro Linero, the administrator who reviews power plants for the state Department of Environmental Protection, said natural gas emits no particulate matter, the tiny particles that can lodge in lungs and aggravate respiratory conditions. Unlike oil or coal, it gives off no sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. It is also easier to control nitrogen oxide emissions, a key component of smog, when natural gas is the fuel rather than oil or coal. Florida Power & Light Co., the largest of the electric companies, has already heavily invested in natural gas generators -- 21 of its 29 non-nuclear power plants are able to run on natural gas. FPL said it turns to natural gas occasionally to save customers money, but the utility, regulators and industry groups could not say how much money is saved by the switch. Another factor behind the projected rise in usage of natural gas is its growing availability. By 2005, natural gas supplies are expected to surge after one pipeline, which will run gas across the Gulf of Mexico, is finished. Local government and industry officials also expect the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will give the green light to one of the Bahamas-to-Florida pipeline projects as well. Still, some environmental groups say that, while they want cleaner energy, they worry that the push to natural gas raises other fears. One concern voiced by civic activists is that the gas pipeline project will create safety hazards at local ports and parks. Enron, which applied to build a Bahamas-to-Florida pipeline, said it has taken steps to make sure it is safe. But Broward officials and a conservationist group, Hollywood-based Save Our Shores, have expressed reservations in filings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which must approve the pipeline project before construction begins. The safety of natural gas pipelines has received more attention recently. After a pipeline exploded in Carlsbad, N.M., last year, killing 12 people, the federal government moved to tighten regulations and require annual testing. And the massive increase in natural gas use by the electric companies dismays some natural gas advocates. They insist the best way to employ it is by piping it directly into homes for water heaters, stoves and even gas-run air conditioning units -- a more efficient and cost-effective use of natural gas than running electric generators, they argue. But state regulators and industry officials say that it is too costly to hook up homes in established neighborhoods because of the expenses in construction and re-landscaping, so expecting large numbers of people to convert from electric to gas appliances is unrealistic. Disagreements aside, the consensus is that the state's power utilities and consumers will soon have another fuel and energy option. "We don't expect [natural gas usage] to decline. If anything, we may see an increase," said Lance Horton, marketing director for People's Gas Co. "At the end of the day, the customer is going to have another choice that was not there before."

FINANCEDebt load smothers Polaroid; Bankruptcy filing pointing to sale, firingsGREG GATLIN10/13/2001Boston HeraldAll Editions020(Copyright 2001)Polaroid Corp., one of Massachusetts' most-storied innovators, sought bankruptcy protection yesterday in a Delaware court to reorganize its business and will seek to hasten a sale of the company. The highly anticipated move capped a rocky period under Chief Executive Gary DiCamillo and marked an extraordinary fall for the 64- year-old Cambridge instant-photography legend.The company that helped define Route 128 as America's Technology Highway, slashed thousands of jobs since its peak in 1978, when it employed nearly 21,000. It has local operations in Bedford, Cambridge, New Bedford, Norton, Norwood, Waltham and Wayland. Polaroid already announced plans this year to cut 3,000 jobs and reduce its work force to 5,500. Yesterday, the company said it will cut more. It's been crushed by huge debt and battered by a sharp drop in demand for its mainstay instant film amid a shift to digital technologies and a weak economy. "How such a place, with so much success and so much technology, could lose that much money and get into so much debt, I don't understand," said Lloyd Taylor, a retired Polaroid chemist who has also consulted for the company. "A lot of people I've known, both retirees and some that are still there, are just totally demoralized." Polaroid, founded by visionary Edwin H. Land in 1937, said it will remain open for business and continue to make and ship its core instant-film products, even as it "accelerates and intensifies" its search for a buyer under bankruptcy court protection. But it will slash operations, with an unspecified number of job cuts expected. Anything that's not part of its core business - products that rely on instant film - is subject to sale or elimination. That includes the company's sunglass division, its photo- identification business, and others. Polaroid, already selling off real estate and other assets, will seek to sell more and will shutter plants. Spokesman Skip Colcord would not provide specifics regarding closings or job cut plans. "I think everything's on the table," he said. Polaroid confirmed it terminated its retiree health and life insurance plans as well as severance payments to former U.S. employees. A federal bankruptcy judge authorized $13.1 million until Monday for employee wages and checks outstanding, said Polaroid lawyer Gregg Galardi. It will seek approval to continue employee health care benefit payments as well, and to honor service warranties on products. In its filing, Polaroid listed $1.81 billion in assets and $948.4 million in debt. Top creditors include Enron Energy Services, Tad Resources International and Dupont Teijin Films US, all with multi- million dollar claims. As expected, Polaroid said it had obtained a commitment for $50 million in so-called debtor-in-possession financing from a bank group led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Polaroid will seek court approval to use $40 million of that loan Monday to meet obligations, including paying suppliers on or after yesterday's filing. Lawyers also said Polaroid had a $33 million offer for its identification business. Crushed by the weight of its debt, including about $600 million owed to bondholders and $335 in bank loans, Polaroid had teetered on the edge of bankruptcy for months, and received a series of waivers on terms of its lending agreements, while it sought a buyer for some or all of its assets. Its once-mighty instant-film business was turned into a cash generator to fund development of new digital-imaging technologies. Earlier this year, Polaroid unveiled new digital printing technology, code-named Opal and Onyx, designed to let consumers and businesses instantly develop prints taken with digital cameras. Some say Polaroid lost a step with the departure of Land, its founder and visionary, who stepped down as chief executive in 1980 and as chairman in 1982. Land died in 1991. A Harvard University dropout and son of a scrap-metal dealer, Land began to research light polarization in the 1920s, focusing on sunglasses, desk lamps and reducing car headlight glare, before turning to instant film. As legend has it, Land took a picture of his young daughter on a vacation in Santa Fe, N.M., and she asked why she couldn't see the picture right away. Land set to work on the problem immediately, and before long was applying for patents. By 1988, Polaroid was trying to fight off a hostile takeover bid. Financier Stanley Gold's Shamrock Holdings had offered $3 billion for Polaroid, or about $45 a share. Company management eventually rebuffed Shamrock, but spent millions in legal fees and racked up a massive debt to block the takeover bid, from which it has yet to recover.

The integrated energy company is expected to meet near-consensus results driven by its wholesale services division, analysts said.Montgomery Securities analyst Daniel Tulis is calculating third-quarter EPS of 42 cents, 1 cent below consensus. Full-year EPS stands at 1.85. Enron's third quarter was marked by the unexpected departure of chief executive Jeff Skilling, for personal reasons, with Chairman Ken Lay reassuming the key position. Lay is likely to remain in the position until it is filled within 12-18 months, Tulis said. The company remains embroiled in arbitration proceedings in India after its 2.9 bln usd Dabhol power plant in India was closed.

UK: UPDATE 1-Rothschild exits base metals, precious unaffected.By Andy Blamey10/11/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Blue-blooded banker N M Rothschild & Sons Ltd said on Thursday it would shut down its base metals trading operations except in Australia - the third base metals trader this week to announce cutbacks. Rothschild remains firmly committed to its precious metals activity, however, company managing director and group treasurer Geoffrey Spice told Reuters.The company, the merchant banking arm and UK branch of the Rothschild family's financial empire, chairs the twice-daily benchmark price-setting London gold fix. "In light of difficult trading conditions in the base metals markets, we have concluded that our limited base metals operation is no longer viable," company Chairman Sir Evelyn de Rothschild said in a statement. "We've been reviewing the situation for quite some time. We've found that trading conditions (in base metals) have been difficult and opportunities have been limited," Spice said. Rothschild would not be taking on any new positions in base metals but would see existing positions on its books through to fruition, according to clients' wishes, he said. Rothschild is a category 2 (associate broker clearing) member of the London Metal Exchange (LME); the company would maintain its LME membership while existing positions run their course and would review it in due course, Spice said. The move to exit base metals will involve the closure of Rothschild's metals sales desk in New York and a number of redundancies in the London and New York trading, sales and support areas, the company said. Employees were informed of the decision on Thursday afternoon; around 20 Rothschild staff in total would be affected by the move, Spice said. The company's Australian base metals activities would continue as normal, however, he added. "Australia has a very strong franchise and will continue to operate in the base metals market," he said. The Rothschild move follows news this week that the Bank of Nova Scotia will scale back its base metals trading desk and that Enron Metals plans to cut around 10 percent of staff as a part of a Europe-wide job cut programme. Base metals traders have been struggling in recent months in the face of falling business volumes and sagging metals prices as continuing economic gloom and uncertainty after the September 11 attacks on the United States leave buyers sidelined. PRECIOUS METALS STRONG Spice stressed, however, that the company's precious metals operations would continue as normal. "We have a very strong position in precious metals which will not be affected in any way," he said. "N M Rothschild remains strongly committed to our core business in precious metals and continues to be at the forefront of spot, forward and option bullion markets and a leading member of the London Bullion Market Association," the company statement said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

INDIA: London court gives Enron India unit respite in row.10/11/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.BOMBAY, Oct 11 (Reuters) - The Indian unit of U.S. energy major Enron Corp . said on Thursday it had obtained a ruling from a London court preventing a provincial government from legally challenging international arbitration proceedings. Enron's Indian unit, Dabhol Power Company, has taken a local Indian utility to the International Court of Arbitration in London for a breach of contract.The utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, had signed a contract to buy the output from Dabhol's $2.9 billion power plant on the western coast of India. It later said it did not need all the power from the 2,184 MW plant, and that it was too expensive. But a local regulatory authority, the Maharashtra State Electricity Commission, said the power company's dispute with the utility fell within its ambit, and that Dabhol could not proceed with the arbitration. This sparked a round of litigation, which is now at a stage where the Bombay High Court must decide whether Dabhol can take the dispute to London. In order to prevent more litigation, Enron obtained an injunction from the Commercial Court in London which restrains the government of Maharashtra, which owns the utility, from also filing a suit in India challenging the international arbitration proceedings. "Over the past few months, the government of Maharashtra and other government entities have taken actions to avoid complying with their contractual obligations," Dabhol said in a statement received late on Thursday. "This has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago." Government officials were not be reached for comment.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. ECUADOR: Three firms accept Ecuador oil contracts at WTI-$6.97.10/11/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.QUITO, Ecuador, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Anglo Energy, Enron and Rio Energy agreed to match the price of $6.97 below West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for Ecuador crude contracts for November, a Petroecuador official said Thursday. Petroecuador last week retendered eight three-month crude contracts, each for 12,000 barrels per day (bpd), following a price dispute with former contract holders that led Ecuador's state oil company to break the contracts.The company awarded Coastal Petroleum two contracts on Friday at WTI minus $6.97, with a floor price for WTI at $20 per barrel, and offered other interested companies the chance to match this price for November. Petroecuador will set the price of Ecuador's crude for December and January. Anglo Energy will take two contracts while Enron and Rio Energy will take one contract each, the official said on the condition of anonymity. It was not immediately clear what would happen to two crude contracts sought by Glencore. Glencore had yet to respond to the offer on Thursday, the source said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. UK: Asian clean tanker freight seen falling - brokers.10/11/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.LONDON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Asian petroleum product trades are likely to benefit from falling freight costs next week, as a raft of surplus tankers makes its way towards Singapore, tanker brokers said on Thursday. "There's a lot of ships ballasting down from Japan, arriving from the middle of next week onwards," said a Singapore broker. "From October 15 to 20 there will be eight to 10 ships in the area. Rates will fall further."He said that intra-Asian freight rates had already started to slide from a spike that topped W280 at the start of the week to W260 on Thursday ($17.52 per tonne). He said that transpacific trade, which often serves to tighten up the intra-Asian market, was dead. "The only arbs that are open are gasoline to Singapore from Europe and jet going the other way," he said. "Cargill did 35,000 tonnes from Malacca to UK-Cont on the High Challenge: we're guessing jet." London brokers said Enron had also booked a ship, the Teekay Freighter, to shift 70,000 tonnes of gasoil from Jamnagar, India to Europe. Brokers said that the Mideast Gulf trade, which occasionally sucks surplus ships out of Asia, was also quiet. Glencore booked two tankers for 40,000 tonne clean cargoes from Yanbu to East Coast India at W235, down 15 points on week-ago levels. "Long Range trades from the Gulf are quiet," said a London broker. "Nothing's happening so it's difficult to know where rates stand, but basically it's going down." A panel of brokers from London's Baltic Exchange pegged the naphtha trade on 75,000 tonners from the Gulf to Japan at W189 late on Wednesday, following a fall of eight points from week-ago levels.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

LOCALDANIA RESIDENTS POKE HOLES IN PIPELINE PLANDavid Fleshler Staff Writer10/11/2001South Florida Sun-SentinelBroward Metro3B(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)A proposal to build a natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas to Broward County drew harsh reviews Wednesday from an audience in Dania Beach. Not a single speaker spoke in favor of the project, although one or two were neutral, during a public workshop held by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the I.T. Parker Community Center."It is totally insane to put a high-pressure natural gas pipeline through such a densely populated area," said Susan Epps, of Oakland Park. "The loss of life and property if there would be an accident would be catastrophic." The commission is preparing an environmental impact statement for the project. More workshops will be held once a draft is ready. The process is expected to take several months. Enron Corp. of Houston proposed the pipeline as a way to meet the state's growing demand for natural gas, a relatively clean and increasingly popular fuel for power plants. Two other companies have made similar proposals. Enron's representatives say construction of the pipeline would do minimal damage to the coral reefs in its path. And it is an extremely safe way to transport natural gas. But few people in the audience saw it that way. Dan Clark, a member of a Broward County group that monitors the health of coral reefs, said that the company's representatives painted too rosy a picture of the project's impact on coral reefs by claiming that drilling a path under the reefs would leave them unharmed. "What they failed to tell you is that they're going to have to assemble the pipe across the second reef and drag it across the second reef," he said. "At a time when we're losing these habitats, we don't want to lose any more, willingly." Some speakers questioned the wisdom of bringing in another source of fossil fuels, however clean it may be, rather than putting more effort in conservation and renewable energy. "Why don't we regulate people's use of energy?" asked Judy Kuchta, of North Beach in Hollywood. "Why do people have to waste energy playing stupid video games and watching mindless TV?" Several speakers worried about the project's effects on John U. Lloyd State Park, a popular beachfront park under which the pipeline would run. "The park simply can't sustain the additional degradation of pipeline construction and operation," said Sara Case, speaking for Save Our Shoreline, a Hollywood conservation group. "The beach is one of Broward County's most important sea turtle nesting areas. Shore birds are attracted to the park. We simply find it difficult to believe that significant environmental damage is not inevitable from this monumental project."

With the analysts, he apparently succeeded. Enron remains oneof Wall Street's most highly rated stocks, even after the largestenergy trader acknowledged that transactions with partnerships runby its chief financial officer led to a writedown of $1.2 billionin shareholder equity.     Lay wasn't so successful with investors, who have abandonedEnron shares, slashing their value 42 percent in a week.     ``You've got a lot of people lining up to say the emperor hasno clothes,'' said Richard Gross of Lehman Brothers Inc., whotoday repeated his ``strong buy'' rating on Enron. Analysts atCredit Suisse First Boston, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and other firmshave also kept their highest ratings on Enron.     Gross still likes the look of Enron's finery. ``The corefranchise here is very valuable,'' he said, and the stock'sdecline more than reflects the ``worst case'' for the company.     In Boston and at similar meetings in Houston and New York,Lay had to explain the unwinding of the partnerships. He and otherEnron executives assured investors the company has no moresurprises in store, according to Greg Phelps, who manages $1.1billion at John Hancock Advisers Inc., and attended the Bostonsession.     The partnerships functioned somewhat like private equityfunds, according to analysts and investors, and includedinvestments that lost money. The Securities and ExchangeCommission has asked for more information about them, Enron saidyesterday.                        One Hold, One Sell     While two analysts have cut their Enron ratings afterlearning about the partnerships, they only dented the company'spopularity on Wall Street.     Michael Heim of A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis loweredhis rating to ``hold'' from ``buy'' on Friday. He said he has beenlooking for discussion of the partnerships in Enron's SEC filingsand is only seeing ``vague references'' that don't leave him witha ``good comfort level.''     With Heim's rating change, Enron went from being the secondmost highly rated stock in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index to the10th, according to Thomson Financial/First Call.     Today, Zach Wagner at Edward Jones & Co. in St. Louis cutEnron to ``reduce'' from ``accumulate.'' Ratings by Edward Jones,which caters to individual investors rather than institutions,aren't tracked by First Call.     First Call translates analyst ratings into numbers, with``strong buy'' a one, ``buy'' a two, and so on, then averages theratings to rank a company's Wall Street popularity. The mosthighly rated stock is Tyco International Ltd., which has fallen 12percent this year.     Enron shares fell 86 cents to $19.79 today.                        Remaining Skeptical     However highly brokerage analysts rate the stock, ``I have toremain skeptical,'' said Barry Borak, energy analyst at David L.Babson & Co., which manages $60 billion in Cambridge,Massachusetts.     ``There's been a huge loss of management credibility atEnron,'' Borak said, because of the partnerships and theunexpected departure in August of Jeffrey Skilling, who had heldthe post of chief executive officer for six months and was heirapparent to Lay. ``Nobody I've talked to thinks (Skilling'sdeparture) is for personal reasons,'' Borak said.     Skilling helped transform Enron from a gas pipeline companyinto the biggest energy trading company. Enron also owns powerplants in deregulated markets.     Borak said Babson doesn't own Enron shares and won't be abuyer ``until I can get better, more thorough information aboutwhat else might pop up in the future.''     Borak and other investors said Enron has a reputation for notproviding enough information about its businesses, and they saidthis makes the positive view of the company on Wall Street moredifficult to understand.     After Skilling resigned, Lay said the company would be moreopen about its businesses. A bullet point in his talk in Bostonwas ``increased transparency of financial and operating results,''according to a handout provided at the Boston meeting.                         Amazed, Dismayed     Prudential Securities Inc. analyst Carol Coale wrote in anote to clients last week that she was ``amazed at the willingnessof Enron's management to break out earnings and expenses to thedegree that it disclosed in the third quarter.''     Coale also wrote that she was ``dismayed by the apparent`disguise' of the additional $1.2 billion equity hit that was notdisclosed in (Enron's) press release and was briefly mentioned inthe earnings conference call.'' Coale kept her rating on Enron at``buy.''     Phelps at John Hancock said that his ``cynical side''believes that investment banking business has helped keep WallStreet recommending Enron stock. ``They provide some goodunderwriting business,'' he said.     Credit Suisse First Boston managed a secondary sale of 12million Enron shares in 1999, with Lehman Brothers actingas co-manager. Credit Suisse has also managed bond sales forEnron this year.Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)2001-10-23 16:38 (New York)Enron Asks Citigroup for $750 Mln Loan, People Say (Update1)     (Updates with closing share price in sixth paragraph.)     New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggestenergy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 millionloan, ensuring access to credit if the company is cut off frommoney markets, say people familiar with the matter.     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the companysaid the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating itsfinances. The company depends on a $3 billion commercial paper, orshort-term debt, program to finance day-to-day operations.     Moody's Investors Service last week placed all $13 billion ofthe company's long-term debt securities on watch for possibledowngrade. Any drop in the rating may cut off Enron from thecommercial paper market, raising the costs of short-term debt.     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to boththe capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's ChiefFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,giving it enough cash to operate normally.     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, alsowouldn't comment.     Shares of Enron, based in Houston, fell 86 cents to $19.79.They have fallen 76 percent this year.                         Complex Financing     An investor sued Enron last week, saying dealings with twopartnerships run by Fastow, LJM Cayman and LJM2 Co-Investment,cost the company $35 million. The suit also calls Fastow'sleadership of the partnerships, set up to remove debt from Enron'sbooks, a conflict of interest.     Enron bought back 62 million shares to unwind positions insome partnerships run by Fastow, said Chief Executive Officer KenLay on the conference call with investors today.     The number of shares differs from a Wall Street Journalreport on Thursday that said Enron had bought back 55 millionshares. The buyback reduced shareholder equity by $1.2 billion,the Journal said.     The company set up the partnerships and other affiliatedcompanies to buy Enron assets such as power plants. Thepartnerships allow Enron to take debt off its books, letting itborrow to invest in its main business of commodities trading,Enron said. Enron trades electricity, natural gas, oil, coal andother commodities.     ```They have complex off-balance sheet financing,'' saidCommerzbank analyst Andre Mead. ``It's difficult to ascertain thefull impact on shareholders.''     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliatedcompanies headed by Fastow. The company has at least $3 billion insuch ``off-the-books'' financing in affiliated companies, RayNiles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report toinvestors.                      Depends on Asset Sales     One partnership, Whitewing Management, owns 250,000 preferredshares that Enron may have to convert to common stock. Whitewingpartners can demand their preferred shares be converted if Enroncommon stock falls below a certain price or if Enron's creditrating drops under investment grade.     Whitewing and other Enron partnerships and trusts includecompany executives as officers and directors, according to recordsfrom the Texas secretary of state.     ``Over the life of these trust structures, Enron has in factissued a sizable amount of equity,'' Enron Treasurer Ben Gilsansaid. Most of that was shares issued to Enron executives as partof a deferred compensation plan, Gilsan said.     The Whitewing partnership was financed with $1.4 billion inbonds sold last year. The partnership used some of the proceeds tobuy Enron power plants and plans to retire the debt by sellingthem, officials said on the conference call. Other companypartnerships operate with the same strategy.     ``Some investors are worried the asset sales won't cover thefull amount (borrowed), and Enron will have to furnish support tothe detriment of shareholders,'' said Commerzbank analyst Meade.                      Commercial Paper Rates     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper untilOct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companieswith the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not oncredit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for apossible downgrade.     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels aboveinvestment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's rate thecompany's debt at investment grade.     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance andadvice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised thecompany on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, alongwith J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billionloan.How Enron Blew ItTexas MonthlyNovember 2001Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?by Mimi Swartz <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.p=hp>=20THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no= way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"= notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=rket intelligence to the energy business.This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas= to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=ntality of the financial markets."The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron= was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in= the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a= company couldn't possibly go wrong.Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for= his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set= off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white= photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure= that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=ld not have been good for me."=20He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious= underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put= upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=nding this."PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked= hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with= the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=uch humiliation?But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack= from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=e of Texas.HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting= in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a= better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive= debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=tarted.=20LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and= he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above= all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he= called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=estment bank would.Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=en said, "Let's go."The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a= cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would= be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the= joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =have ever imagined.THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an= industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to= create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one= day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered= with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with= the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could= make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=d say," one loyalist says.=20And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.= Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=rts).But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations lar=gest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The divisio=n had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $=2 billion to $7 billion. "Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil= in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track," the New =York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skill=ing had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to tran=sforming another."FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"= sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron= client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=e against the usual winter downturn?But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year= deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people= in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=ted.There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became= overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=d at all.=20While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's= idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they= went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser= for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away= for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery= store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,= he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ="They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says= one former Enron executive.In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.= E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=ou bleed to death."BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.= "It was the technology era."To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=rate America.But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour= deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most= visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give= it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much= diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start= afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.= Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =culture than running a business."=20As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay= announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely= well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of= the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media= was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in= January.Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a= very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might= be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =with its lights on.")But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors= believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as= it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for= buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,= Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=rry more weight."This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.= "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it= now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as= one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=on that's better suited for good times than bad."As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness= and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=rale problem."That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news= of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to= their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=act, he is already shopping for office space."This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. ="There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=et it."Enron Fails to Smooth Things OverBy Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>Senior ColumnistTheStreet.com10/23/2001 01:07 PM EDTURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002864.html>Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) held a special conference call Tuesday= to address investor concerns that have weighed heavily on its stock.=20But worries may persist after the energy trader offered few new details and= the CEO publicly sparred with a gadfly investor over a shadowy off-balance= sheet transaction.=20The transaction that has drawn most attention in the past week is a complex= financing that Enron entered into with a partnership called LJM2, which wa=s led by Enron's finance chief Andrew Fastow. Terminating this arrangement =led to a $1.2 billion equity reduction in the third quarter. Monday, Enron =stock plunged 20% after the company said the Securities and Exchange Commis=sion is probing "related party transactions." Executives declined to respon=d to questions about Fastow's role in the LJM2 partnership on the Tuesday c=all.=20Another key issue is the impact of the equity reduction. The company said o=n the call that its share count would decline by 60 million in the fourth q=uarter, due to the termination of the LJM2 financing. But CEO Ken Lay said =the company wouldn't be increasing its earnings guidance of $1.80 a share f=or 2001 and $2.15 for 2002.=20When a share count drops, earnings per share should normally increase, assu=ming the earnings number stays constant. The 60 million shares are equivale=nt to about 6.5% of the company's diluted total in the third quarter. As a =result, Enron should have raised its per-share profits forecast by about th=at much, assuming constant earnings.=20When asked on the call if earnings per share guidance would be increasing, =CEO Lay replied that the company had previously increased its guidance for =this year. He then affirmed the 2002 number.=20Now, to be fair, Enron may not be forecasting lower earnings. The planned r=eduction in shares may simply bring the total share count back close to a l=evel in the fourth quarter and 2002 that analysts had originally expected. =Notably, the share count in the third quarter jumped by 20 million, meaning= a fourth-quarter reduction might not change matters that much. Alternative=ly, Enron may beat fourth-quarter estimates by 6.5%; perhaps the company ha=s simply chosen not to increase guidance at this stage, given uncertainties= in the economy. In any case, more clarity on this matter is clearly needed=.=20Calls to Enron weren't immediately returned. The stock edged up 2% Tuesday =after falling nearly 40% since last week amid worries about complex off-bal=ance sheet deals.=20The call, arranged after Enron's Monday plunge, contained a lot of queries =about two trusts, called Marlin II and Whitewing, against which Enron borro=wed some $3.4 billion. Lay became testy after questioning by Richard Grubma=n of Boston-based hedge fund Highfields Capital Management. Grubman, who wa=s called an "a--hole" by Enron's former CEO Jeff Skilling on an April confe=rence call, was trying to find out the value of water assets held by Marlin= II. The optimal way of paying back money borrowed through the trust is to =sell the water assets.=20Grubman's line of questioning implied that the Marlin assets were worth onl=y about $100 million, meaning Enron would have to find about $900 million t=o pay off the Marlin II-related debt. Grubman arrived at $100 million after= factoring in what he saw as the effects of a third-quarter writedown to wa=ter assets, some of which are included in Marlin II.=20Lay disputed the $100 million number. At one point, he accused Grubman of d=riving Enron's stock down and monopolizing the Tuesday conference call. In =the middle of Grubman's comments, Lay told the call operator to go to the n=ext caller.=20Grubman didn't immediately return a call seeking comment.=20If Enron has to find $900 million, this can be done by issuing stock or rai=sing cash on its balance sheet. If the latter route is taken, Enron says it='s likely to use asset sales to generate the cash. Enron executives said li=quidity would be sufficient and detailed at least $3.35 billion in availabl=e credit lines.=20But if Enron's debt-to-capital ratio exceeds 65%, the covenants on some of =those lines are broken. After the $1.2 billion equity writedown and other c=harges taken in the third quarter, that ratio is probably about 50%-55% (En=ron hasn't released a third-quarter balance sheet to arrive at an exact cal=culation). It would take $3 billion in further writedowns or charges to pus=h Enron's debt-to-capital ratio up to 65%.=20Stocks=20More Static For Enron=20Forbes.com staff, Forbes.com10.23.01, 11:15 AM ET=20NEW YORK - Enron scrambled again to reassure investors this morning, after =it disclosed yesterday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had= asked for information on partnerships run by Chief Financial Officer Andre=w Fastow and other executives.=20Enron (nyse: ENE ) last week reported a third-quarter loss of $638 million =after taking $1.01 billion in charges on ill-fated investments.

Fastow, realized millions of dollars in profits in transactions it= did with Enron, according to an internal partnership document.=20The partnership, in some instances, benefited from renegotiating the terms =of existing deals with the Houston energy company in ways that improved the= partnership's financial positions or reduced its risk of losses.Mr. Fastow, and possibly a handful of partnership associates, realized more= than $7 million last year in management fees and about $4 million in capit=al increases on an investment of nearly $3 million in the partnership, whic=h was set up in December 1999 principally to do business with Enron.=20The profits from the deals were disclosed in a financial report to investor=s in the partnership, LJM2 Co-Investment LP, that was signed by Mr. Fastow =as the general partner and dated April 30. In one case, the report indicate=s the partnership was able to improve profits by terminating a transaction =early.=20The LJM2 arrangement has become controversial for Enron, as shareholders an=d analysts have raised questions about whether it posed a conflict by putti=ng the company's chief financial officer, who has a fiduciary duty to Enron= shareholders, in a position of reaping financial rewards for representing =LJM2 investors in business deals with Enron. Investors in LJM2 include Wach=ovia Corp., General Electric Co.'s General Electric Capital Corp. and Credi=t Suisse Group's Credit Suisse First Boston.=20Attention has focused on Mr. Fastow's partnership activities at a tumultuou=s time for Enron, which over the past decade grew enormously by becoming th=e nation's biggest energy-trading company.=20This year, though, it has been hit by a string of troubles, from soured bus=iness initiatives to executive departures. On Tuesday, Enron announced a $6=18 million third-quarter loss, because of a $1.01 billion write-off on inve=stments in broadband telecommunications, retail energy services and Azurix =Corp., a water company. A small chunk of that write-off, about $35 million,= was attributed to ending certain LJM2-related transactions. That terminati=on also produced a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity as th=e company decided to repurchase 55 million shares that had been part of LJM=2 deals.=20At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron was down 9.9%=, or $3.20, to $29 a share. Within the past year, the stock had topped $80 =a share.=20Enron officials didn't have any comment about the LJM2 partnership document=. Enron has consistently said its dealings with LJM2 have been proper. They= said the LJM2 deals, like ones done with other parties, were aimed at help=ing hedge against fluctuating market values of its assets and adding source=s of capital.=20Mr. Fastow has declined several requests for an interview about LJM2. In la=te July, he formally severed his ties with LJM2, as a result of what Enron =officials said was growing unease by Wall Street analysts and major shareho=lders. Mr. Fastow has been finance chief of Enron since 1997 and has been w=ith the firm 11 years, which included extensive work setting up and managin=g company investments.=20Michael Kopper, a former Enron executive who an Enron spokesman said is now= helping to operate LJM2, declined to comment. He also wouldn't describe hi=s relation to LJM2.=20In his April 30 report, Mr. Fastow said the partnership, which raised $394 =million, had invested in several Enron-related deals involving power plants= and other assets as well as company stock. The document said LJM2 sought a= 29% internal rate of return. That was down from a 48% targeted rate of ret=urn at the end of 2000, which the document said was due in part to a declin=e in the value of LJM2's investment in New Power Co., an Enron-related ener=gy retailer. In some transactions, LJM2 did much better than the 29% target=, though this sometimes involved renegotiating individual deals.=20In September 2000, the partnership invested $30 million in "Raptor III," wh=ich involved writing put options committing LJM2 to buy Enron stock at a se=t price for six months. Four months into this deal, LJM2 approached Enron t=o settle the investment early, "causing LJM2 to receive its $30 million cap=ital invested plus $10.5 million in profit," the report said. The renegotia=tion was before a decline in Enron's stock price, which could have forced L=JM2 to buy Enron shares at a loss of as much as $8 each, the document indic=ated.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>Staff ReporterTheStreet.com10/19/2001 06:59 AM EDTURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10002661.html>1. Bayer Fighting the Bears?One beneficiary of the anthrax scare has been Bayer AG (BAYZY:OTC BB ADR - =news - commentary) , the German chemical maker, which has seen its share pr=ice gain 10.4% since the terrorist attacks. But investors bidding up the st=ock might be getting ahead of themselves.=20Bayer makes Cipro, a leading treatment for anthrax. But while the demand fo=r Cipro is high, sales from the drug are only a small portion of the compan=y's overall revenue, which totaled 30.9 billion euros last year (and, accor=ding to analysts, will increase even more this year, due to its acquisition= of Aventis CropScience, a crop protection and production company). To put =the demand for Cipro in context, J.P. Morgan expects U.S. sales of the drug= to be approximately 1.2 billion euros for 2001.=20Even emergency purchases of Cipro probably won't add that much to Bayer's o=verall revenues. The president has asked for $643 million for antibiotics t=o combat bioterrorist attacks. While it's possible that sum will be increas=ed, not all the money would be spent on Cipro.=20Besides, it's not even clear that Bayer will remain the only producer of Ci=pro. Though the company holds the patent for the drug, there's some pressur=e in Congress for the government to purchase a generic version from other m=anufacturers.=20On another front, Bayer is currently battling a class-action lawsuit relate=d to an anti-cholesterol drug implicated in a number of deaths. It was forc=ed to withdraw the drug from the market.=20Bayer may offer protection against anthrax, but that doesn't mean it's a re=fuge for investors.=202. Losses at Twice the PriceYou know things are bad for a company when its losses per share are double =the price of the shares themselves. That's the case for i2 Technologies (IT=WO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , the supply-chain software maker. After mar=ket close on Tuesday, the company posted losses under generally accepted ac=counting principles that amounted to $5.5 billion, or $13.25 per share, for= the latest quarter, including all charges.=20In other words, i2's losses were more than twice the value of its share pri=ce, which closed at $5.69 before the announcement.=20Much of the huge writedown reflects amortized goodwill from the purchase of= Aspect Development in March 2000.=20To be fair, investors in companies that have made big acquisitions like i2 =typically focus on pro forma earnings, which exclude charges and extraordin=ary items. By that measure, i2's losses didn't look quite so bad: The compa=ny met analysts' consensus expectations with a loss of $55.3 million, or 13= cents per share.=20Still, investors met i2's earnings with disapproval, knocking the stock dow=n 25% the day after they were reported.=203. Microsoft's Bag of TricksIn times like these, there's comfort in knowing business goes on as usual a=t many U.S. companies. Just like the old days, Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq - new=s - commentary) is in the hot seat for its sharklike behavior toward a comp=etitor.=20It stands accused of sending 3,000 fake cereal boxes emblazoned with the wo=rds "Microsoft Server Crunch" to customers of rival server software maker N=ovell. The boxes, according to Novell, contained "a number of false and mis=leading statements" intended as putdowns of Novell products.=20Among the attempted insults were some not-so-clever plays on packaged food.= For example, in a reference to Novell's flagship software product, a line =on the Microsoft boxes read: "What's the expiration date on that NetWare pl=atform?" (A round of applause, please, for those gut-splittingly funny engi=neers.)=20The boxes also said Novell is shifting its focus from software to consultin=g services, which Novell says isn't true.=20Microsoft spokesman Jim Desler said the cereal boxes were primarily intende=d to advertise Microsoft services, not to slight Novell. "It was all in the= theme of a mock cereal box," he said. "It was a modest campaign."=20In response to Novell's complaints, he says Microsoft sent out a letter in =September to recipients of the boxes to clarify some of its statements, and= it's just agreed to send another letter to appease the company. For the re=cord, Novell said it's not calling off its lawsuit for unspecified money da=mages.=204. AMD's Feisty PledgeCEOs don't get their jobs by being eloquent, and it probably would be too m=uch to expect them to sound statesmanlike. But sometimes their oratorical r=ough edges cross the line into embarrassing.=20Case in point: Comments from Jerry Sanders, the CEO of Advanced Micro Devic=es (AMD:NYSE - news - commentary) , which earlier this week reported a loss= for the first time in almost three years. The company, facing harsh pricin=g competition from Intel (INTC:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , said its reven=ue was down 22% from a year ago and it expects a likely operating loss for =the fourth quarter.=20Given recent declines in consumer confidence, the downturn is likely to be =extended by several quarters, Sanders admitted. But in a conference call, h=e indulged in some spirited fist-shaking. Citing the company's so-called "H=ammer" architecture for processors, Sanders declared, "We feel that when th=e upturn comes, we're going to kick ---."=20Does this guy carry around a surfboard in his car or what? Mr. Sanders, mee=t Mr. Reeves.=20OK, so we actually kind of admire Sanders' never-capitulate spirit. But his= comment seems a little redundant, because just about everybody will look b=etter when the economy turns around. Because that may not be anytime soon, =what matters is how companies weather the interim -- feisty pledges notwith=standing.=205. Enron's Rabbit-From-a-Hat StyleAnalysts have complained for some time about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - com=mentary) rabbit-from-a-hat style accounting, with which the company produce=d results that wowed investors without making it quite clear where they cam=e from. Now that its business has taken a sour turn, that tendency has gott=en even more unsettling.=20To cap off its disappointing earnings results this week -- Enron posted a s=teep loss after taking a $1.01 billion charge -- the company let drop that =its shareholder equity had decreased by $1.2 billion.=20In a conference call, CEO Kenneth Lay attributed the reduction in equity to= the "removal of an obligation to issue a number of shares." According to a= report in The Wall Street Journal, Enron repurchased 55 million shares iss=ued through a series of transactions involving LJM Capital, a partnership t=hat until recently was headed up by Enron's CFO.=20TSC's Peter Eavis has written that it appears Enron lent LJM money to buy E=nron stock.=20Ironically, the company boasted in its earnings release this week that it h=ad expanded reporting of its financial results, presumably to quiet its acc=ounting critics.=20Enron's transactions have been so labyrinthine that it's hard to identify e=xactly if or how they were inappropriate. But the latest revelation, to say= the least, does nothing to bolster the company's credibility.

All rights reserved.How do the Washington lobbying firms with the heftiest incomes put themselv=es in the upper echelon of K Street practitioners? Van Scoyoc Associates In=c. does it by signing up a stable of smaller clients and working hard to re=tain them. Quinn Gillespie & Associates doesn't have a long client list, bu=t it is at the top of the heap in terms of average fee per client. Greenber=g Traurig, meanwhile, lured away a rival firm's top rainmaker-and his lucra=tive book of clients.=20These are just some of the business strategies revealed in National Journal='s survey of the 10 Washington lobbying firms with the highest fee income f=rom January 1 to June 30. The four top firms at midyear 2001 are the same o=nes as a year earlier: perennial powerhouses Cassidy & Associates Inc.; Pat=ton Boggs; Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld; and Verner, Liipfert, Bernhar=d, McPherson and Hand.But two new players-boasting huge growth rates-are among the firms nipping =at the heels of these top dogs.=20Greenberg Traurig, which came in at No. 5 in National Journal's midyear 200=1 rankings, had never before been in the top tier of Washington lobbying fi=rms. According to PoliticalMoneyLine, which compiles a comprehensive annual= list of all lobbying firms, Greenberg Traurig had the 35th-highest income =during the first six months of last year.=20And No. 7 in the midyear 2001 rankings is Quinn Gillespie, another first-ti=me member of the top 10. Formed just a year and a half ago by former Clinto=n White House Counsel Jack Quinn and Ed Gillespie-a one-time adviser to Hou=se Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas-the firm has seen its fortunes rocke=t upward. Quinn Gillespie was No. 13 in the first six months of 2000.=20In between these two newcomers is Van Scoyoc Associates, ranked at No. 6. T=here has been a steady rise for Van Scoyoc, which was No. 28 in fee income =at the end of 1996, the year in which the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act firs=t took effect.=20Rounding out the top 10 at midyear 2001 are stalwarts Williams & Jensen; Wa=shington Council Ernst & Young; and Barbour Griffith & Rogers.=20National Journal ranks the top-10 lobbying firms every six months by tallyi=ng the fees that firms report to the House and Senate as required under the= 1995 legislation. National Journal tabulates total fees for only the 25 to=p firms in PoliticalMoneyLine's comprehensive annual survey.=20With its $16.68 million in fees for the first six months of the year, Cassi=dy & Associates continued to blow away the competition. The last time any f=irm reported a six-month total larger than Cassidy's was during the first h=alf of 1998, when Verner, Liipfert led the way. During the first six months= of this year, Cassidy & Associates received a massive fee of $1 million fr=om the Taiwan Studies Institute, a think tank with close ties to the Taiwan=ese government; Boeing Co. paid Cassidy & Associates $600,000; and Tiffany =& Co. paid it $400,000 to lobby on legislation that would bar diamonds mine=d in conflict-ridden areas of the world from entering the global market.=20Despite the economic downturn and the terrorist threat, lobbying goes on, c=ompany Chairman Gerald S.J. Cassidy said. "During difficult times, people c=ome to Washington with their problems. During more-robust times, they come =seeking opportunities."=20But the biggest story at midyear was the rise of Greenberg Traurig. The fir=m, which posted just $1.71 million in lobbying fees during the first half o=f 2000, saw that amount more than quadruple to nearly $8.7 million this yea=r. Much of the credit goes to Jack Abramoff, the conservative K Street move=r and shaker who is an ally of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas. Last= year, Abramoff left his old firm, Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds, an=d brought $3 million in business with him to Greenberg Traurig. Preston Gat=es, which was ranked in the top five during Abramoff's tenure, dropped out =of National Journal's rankings this year. The lobbying firm's fees fell by =nearly 50 percent.=20Abramoff continued to make rain at Greenberg Traurig, billing $860,000 to t=he Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, $500,000 to the Commonwealth of the= Northern Mariana Islands, and $300,000 to garment manufacturers that opera=te in that U.S. territory. A few new clients also forked over big bucks: th=e Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana ($440,000); Voor Huisen Project Management, =a homebuilder with international operations ($300,000); and the American In=ternational Center ($100,000). Despite initial concerns among some Greenber=g Traurig partners about whether Abramoff would fit in, Abramoff insists th=at his team of lobbyists has been "totally integrated" into the firm.=20But Abramoff wasn't the only one responsible for Greenberg Traurig's higher= earnings. Ronald W. Kleinman, a former State Department lawyer, persuaded =Congress with the help of several Greenberg Traurig colleagues to pass Sect=ion 2002 of the 2000 Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act. Th=is section of the law ordered the Treasury Secretary to use Cuban governmen=t funds that are frozen in U.S. banks to compensate the families of three m=en who had won multimillion-dollar judgments against Cuba under a 1996 amen=dment to the Foreign Sovereignty Immunities Act. The amendment allows victi=ms of terrorism or their families to sue states that are on the U.S. list o=f state sponsors of terrorism.=20Greenberg Traurig represented the families of Armando Alejandre, Carlos Alb=erto Costa, and Mario M. de la Pena-three members of Brothers to the Rescue=, a Cuban-American group that rescues Cubans in the waters off Florida. The= three men died when their plane was shot down over international waters on= February 24, 1996. The families sued Cuba and were awarded $96.7 million i=n damages by a U.S. District Court judge in 1997. The State Department oppo=sed payment, but President Clinton signed the trafficking bill. Greenberg T=raurig reported a fee of $4 million.=20Fred W. Baggett, the chair of Greenberg Traurig's governmental practice gro=up, said this was a one-time fee, but he added that the Cuban case "establi=shed a platform so that the firm can support undertaking those one-time eff=orts in the future," and noted, "We have a few coming down the pipeline."==20Baggett said the firm has cases involving an American killed in Jerusalem b=y the Palestinian group Hamas, and Americans who were used as human shields= in Iraq during the Persian Gulf War. None of the Americans was killed, and= all were eventually released.=20Taking the flip side of the mega-fee approach was Van Scoyoc Associates, wh=ich reported receiving no fee above $180,000. Nonetheless, the firm continu=ed its steady rise. A key reason, said firm President H. Stewart Van Scoyoc=, was the ability to recruit and retain clients. The firm signed up 34 clie=nts between January 1 and June 30, while only nine out of 159 clients termi=nated contracts during the period.=20"We work hard at defining the relationship with a client before we sign a c=ontract," said Van Scoyoc. "We make sure we're clear on the goals and objec=tives, and in a typical relationship, we don't guarantee that we can do eve=rything." The firm's $6.24 million total for the first half of 2001 was 23 =percent higher than its fees for the same period last year.=20Quinn Gillespie's ascent into the top 10 was more along the lines of Greenb=erg Traurig's. Quinn Gillespie's billings were almost $6.09 million at midy=ear 2001, a 71 percent rise over the same period last year. The firm has on=ly 34 paying clients, but the average fee per client-$180,000-is the highes=t among the top 10. During the six months, the British Columbia Lumber Trad=e Council paid a fee of $540,000 to Quinn Gillespie, while Enron Corp. paid= $525,000. The Canadian group hoped its high-powered lobbyists would win gr=eater access for Canadian lumber in the United States, but U.S. tariffs wer=e reinstated earlier this year. Lobbying for Enron focused on energy deregu=lation, particularly in California. Enron is a major creditor of Southern C=alifornia Edison, the utility whose financial woes resulted in power shorta=ges in California last summer.=20Quinn Gillespie's staff has grown from nine at the time of the founding to =nearly 30 today. "We like to think we have a toolbox here-people who may be= Republicans or Democrats but who also have different skills that benefit t=he client," Quinn said.=20Patton Boggs had fees of $10.26 million in the first six months of 2001, bu=t that was just a 5 percent rise over the same period in 2000. Still, the f=irm leapfrogged over Verner, Liipfert to capture the No. 2 ranking. Patton =Boggs earned $360,000 from Russia's government-owned NTV television network=, which was at the center of a controversy earlier this year when the gover=nment took over the independent network and ousted its staff.=20Akin, Gump also jumped past Verner, Liipfert to No. 3 in the rankings, post=ing $9.48 million in fees-a 16 percent increase over a year earlier. Akin, =Gump's biggest client was the troubled tire manufacturer Bridgestone/Firest=one Inc., which paid just over $1.5 million in fees. Akin, Gump also earned= big money from AT&T ($800,000) and the Gila River Indian Community ($620,0=00).=20At No. 4, Verner, Liipfert saw the biggest drop in fees, taking in $8.84 mi=llion in the first six months of 2001-down 16 percent from the same period =in 2000. Verner, Liipfert lost lucrative contracts with Puerto Rico after t=he government there changed hands last year. (See this issue, p. 3273.)=20Rounding out the top-10 rankings, Williams & Jensen at No. 8 billed $5.68 m=illion, a 12 percent increase over the first half of 2000, while Washington= Council Ernst & Young saw its fees drop 11 percent to $5.5 million. The fi=rm fell four places to No. 9 in the rankings. Barbour Griffith & Rogers's f=ee income was up 7 percent to $5.48 million, putting the firm at No. 10.=20Falling out of the midyear top-10 rankings were Preston Gates-No. 6 at midy=ear 2000-and PricewaterhouseCoopers, No. 7 last year. PricewaterhouseCooper=s's billings were $5 million for the period, a 6 percent drop from the firs=t half of 2000.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

From the U.S. Supreme Court to Congress and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Houston-based energy and commodities trading giant has spread its open-market gospel."Five years ago we clearly thought we would be much farther along than we are now," Rick Shapiro, Enron's managing director of government affairs, told Reuters in an interview on Friday. "Finishing the job of making wholesale markets work across the U.S. is our number one objective," Shapiro said. Enron has a large stake in the regulatory debate. With wide-ranging commodity positions from lumber to pulp to bandwidth, oil and natural gas, its strategy hinges on the ability to transfer those products from buyer to seller more cheaply and quickly than its competitors. For the power market, that means Enron needs easy access to electric transmission lines, the interstate highway system that allows it to wheel supplies between regions and capitalize on short-term price imbalances. UTILITIES BLOCK COMPETITION Enron's big problem? Traditional utilities own transmission lines and have shaped the rules to block new entrants and favor their own generation, Shapiro said. "Vertically integrated monopolies have been very effective in delaying wholesale competition across the board," he said. In its pleas to Supreme Court justices and regulators, Enron has tried to empower federal regulators to force utilities to open their wires to competition. The Supreme Court last week heard oral arguments in a case that could be a watershed for the U.S. power industry and decide whether FERC has the right to drive competition on state transmission networks. In a classic battle of state versus federal jurisdictional turf, Enron wants the court to give FERC more authority to compel states to open their transmission grids to competitors. Meanwhile, New York has brought a companion case that says FERC has gone too far and the court should give control of transmission wires back to the states. "This is an example of an agency that has overstepped its bounds," Lawrence Malone, general counsel for the New York State Public Service Commission, said at the oral argument. New York wants the court to revoke FERC's authority to regulate retail sales, contending electricity involved in such sales stays within state boundaries and is not subject to federal legislation. "I think a victory for New York would be absolutely disastrous for consumers across the country," Shapiro said. "FERC has jurisdiction. All they need to do is exercise it," Shapiro said, echoing Enron lawyers' case to Supreme Court justices that existing laws give FERC the power to do Enron's will. Enron does not see a recent congressional push for energy legislation as key to its plans, Shapiro said. "FERC is doing its job on the electricity front. I'm not sure that legislation is required on that front." FERC SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS With new Chairman Pat Wood at the helm, FERC is moving in the right direction to drive competition, Shapiro said. "It's early in his tenure," Shapiro said of Wood. "Many of the signs are promising." Wood has made so-called regional transmission organizations a high priority and set aggressive agency rules to drive utilities to join them. RTOs establish common rules that allow utilities to smoothly trade bulk electricity across the borders of their own local transmission systems. Enron sees RTOs as a positive step toward competition. In what he called a "carrots and sticks" approach, Wood signaled in late September that utilities must either join RTOs or face losing the right to sell power in wholesale markets. FERC will hold a week-long meeting on RTOs beginning Monday. Enron is skeptical that carrots are useful, and is a bigger fan of sticks, Shapiro said. Utilities have "gotten quite fat over the last nine or 10 years," Shapiro said, and will shrug off FERC's incentives. "I'm not sure there are a sufficient number of carrots in the world right now to incentivize these companies," Shapiro said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. UK: Enron's European electricity trading volumes soar.10/12/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.LONDON, Oct 12 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Enron on Friday said it traded five times as much wholesale electricity in continental Europe during the first half of this year as in the same period last year. Continental power trading director Gregor Baeumerich told Reuters the company traded 523 terawatt hours in the first half - roughly equivalent to annual German power demand - up from 93 terawatt hours in the first half of 2000."On average we are now doing around 200 deals a day with about 300 counterparties," he said. Liquidity in Germany, Europe's biggest power market, had risen partly due to more trading by municipal utilities, he said. Baeumerich said volumes in the French power market had risen sharply in recent weeks after Electricite de France last month auctioned off access to 1,200 megawatts of it generation capacity. He said annual contracts for physical baseload power for 2002 were trading daily. Up to 30 companies participated in the French market. "Utilities from across the continent are trading the French market," said Baeumerich. Much of the trading took place on France's borders with neighbouring countries, he said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

The high-yield loan, the largest announced since theterrorist attacks of Sept. 11, will include $450 million ofworking capital. Another $450 million will be replaced by a junkbond of the same size, the bankers said.     Merrill, which advised Northwest on its acquisition, willmanage the bond sale. Credit Suisse advised Enron Corp. on thesale of Portland for $2.9 billion in cash, stock and assumed debtto Northwest.     Portland, Oregon-based Northwest also plans to issue $150million of common equity once the acquisition is closed, accordingto Chief Executive Richard Reiten. The company expects a nine-month to 12-month regulatory approval period, Reiten said.     Northwest is forming a holding company to take on the debtneeded to finance the transaction. Standard & Poor's said that thedebt at the holding company is expected to be rated belowinvestment grade.

UK-based energy and commodities broker Spectron's electronic platform for the trading of London Metal Exchange (LME) contracts has become required viewing for traders alongside the LME's own system LME Select and the Enron Group's EnronOnline."I think we've proved that people will trade LME derivatives contracts online, because there are some great advantages to doing so," Gross told Reuters in a telephone interview. "And unlike the physical markets, where things haven't really taken off online, all three platforms are pretty much indispensable to the market." Both Spectron and LME Select are neutral platforms in which Category 1 and Category 2 LME members trade with each other, while EnronOnline is open to a wider membership but has Enron itself as the sole counterparty in each transaction. This leaves a gap in the market for a multi-party trading system open to industry participants beyond the immediate trading community, Gross suggested. "I think the clear trend for metals derivatives trading for the future is for open platforms which would allow dealers and clients in the market to interact with each other online," he said. Direct access for clients to an electronic trading environment could mean changes in the role of the broker, he said. "Clients will have the advantage of more control, more visibility and more transparency in what they do. However, they'll have to pay for services," Gross said. "You could see a situation where dealers specialise in different areas - certain dealers would provide credit functions, certain institutions would provide clearing, others would provide execution and certain companies would provide market-making." DIFFICULT CONDITIONS Difficult market conditions are already forcing metals traders to rethink their activities; this week alone has seen N.M. Rothschild & Sons exit base metals trading and both Bank of Nova Scotia and Enron looking to scale back. "On the LME now you've got low volumes, falling volatilities, falling prices and we're in the grips of a bear market. It's very, very poor for business in general," Gross said. "There are too many dealers around chasing a shrinking amount of business...Each company is going to have to look very carefully at their business and their staffing levels." Spectron has not been immune from declining volumes. "Our volumes for the first 12 months of operation were fantastic, way beyond what we had expected. However, our volumes have fallen in the recent quarter," Gross said. "That's due to two factors: first, the overall market activity is lower, and second LME Select has managed to attract some of the business that we would previously have had 100 percent of." The company is now looking at ways to further develop its trading platform. "We're beginning to investigate ways to add certain features and do things differently. That might involve creating an alternative platform where clients could access prices and thereby widen the service," Gross said. But, he stressed, "we have to keep the interests of our dealer clients foremost." UNCERTAINTY In the current environment, the LME's refusal to throw its weight behind either open-outcry floor trade or its new screen system - the exchange has taken pains not to express any preference and to "allow the market to decide" - may prove to be counterproductive, Gross said. "By having two systems running side by side ... the exchange is almost moving in two totally different directions," he said. "There's a feeling that the ring is doomed, which doesn't do anything to encourage its use, while the reluctance to fully back electronic trading means that you're still only seeing a trickle of business going through Select in terms of overall volumes." While preferences vary in different sectors of the market, the current uncertainty is helping no-one, he said: "Metals traders just want to trade. They just want to know with some kind of certainty how the market will be structured in future so they can structure their business to support that and make money."Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: Citizen wins two Petroecuador oil contracts.10/12/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Oil firm Citizen won the remaining two of Ecuador's crude oil contracts by matching the price differential of $6.97 below West Texas Intermediate (WTI) set by another bider, Petroecuador said Friday. Petroecuador awarded U.S.-based Citizen two contracts, each of 12,000 barrels per day (bpd), for three months after matching Coastal Petroleum's bid of $6.97 under WTI, with a floor price for WTI at $20 per barrel.Petroecuador last week retendered eight three-month crude lots, each for 12,000 bpd, following a price dispute with former contract holders that led Ecuador's state oil company to break the deals. Enron Corp. and Rio Energy were awarded earlier this week one 12,000 bpd contract each, while Anglo Energy and Coastal each will take two contracts. The new contract holders will start loading their first cargo during the first half of November, a Petroecuador official said. Petroecuador will set the price of Ecuador's crude for December and January based on market values.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity, reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years on Tuesday. The company took $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments, measures Enron executives said credit rating agencies were comfortable with.UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said on Wednesday he was "not thrilled" by the announcement during a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings. And for good reason. Moody's Investors Service subsequently issued a statement saying it had placed all of Enron's long-term debt obligations on review for a possible downgrade. "There appears to be much more work ahead before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the past are fully resolved," Barone said. The writedowns on poorly performing assets and a more detailed breakdown of the company's operations went some way to appeasing Wall Street after a tumultuous year in which Enron's stock lost about two-thirds of its value, but analysts said they were not about to let Enron off the hook just yet. Bear Stearns analyst Robert Winters said he remained concerned about Enron's quality of earnings and cash flow. Winters said he believed Enron would have liked to take even bigger charges and writedowns, but was unable to do so without putting its credit ratings at risk, which could adversely affect some of the company's financing arrangements. "Problem assets and overvalued assets on the balance sheet remain, particularly overseas," he said. One such asset is Enron's 65 percent stake, valued at $1 billion, in the Dabhol power plant project in India, which has been stalled because of a long-running payments dispute with its only customer, a local utility company. Enron's stock closed down $1.64, or 4.85 percent, at $32.20 on Wednesday. For the year to date the stock is down about 61 percent, underperforming the Standard & Poor's utilities index , which has fallen some 24 percent over the same period. Enron was a Wall Street favorite last year when its stock posted a gain of 87 percent, driven by enthusiasm for the company's broadband plans and the success of its EnronOnline Internet energy and commodity trading platform. But the stock has fallen sharply this year as sentiment toward broadband soured, new chief executive Jeff Skilling resigned after just six months in the job and wrangling continued over the Dabhol power plant project.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. USA: UPDATE 1-RTO seen key to boosting New England power supply.By Scott DiSavino10/17/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Energy companies said the future development of new power plants and transmission lines in the U.S. Northeast hinges, in part, on setting up a Northeast Regional Transmission Organization (RTO). RTOs are predominantly for-profit groups established to bring all of a region's high-voltage transmission lines under central control while ensuring equal access to the lines to all power suppliers seeking to market their goods across the grid.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees the interstate wholesale power market, believes RTOs will benefit consumers by enhancing competition among power providers, in turn improving service and driving down rates. "If FERC can drive the Northeast RTO to closure in a reasonable period of time, it will accelerate the development of new transmission and generation," Enron Corp.'s managing director of global government affairs, Rick Shapiro, told Reuters. Houston-based Enron is the nation's top energy marketer. "How and when the RTO gets implemented will radically impact the market. It's crucial to the development of the market in New England," Mirant Corp. spokesman Ray Long told Reuters. Energy provider Mirant, of Atlanta, has 1,400 megawatts (MW) of generation in New England. The company is currently adding another 700 MW to its Canal station in Massachusetts. "Once we get the permits for Canal, we will reassess whether to proceed with the project. A big part of that assessment will depend on the RTO process," Long said. THE NORTHEAST RTO FERC wants to see four super-regional RTOs created in the U.S. - in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. Several regions have taken long strides toward developing RTOs, including a not-for-profit model proposed in the Midwest and rival for-profit plans vying for FERC approval in the West. FERC Chairman Patrick Wood, seeking to spur the development of RTOs, favors giving utilities until Dec. 15 to join one or forfeit their right to sell electricity in the wholesale market, though the commission has not voted on this plan. The Northeast RTO will include New England, New York, the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) region and possibly parts of eastern Canada. FERC said it wants the Northeast RTO to be built on the PJM market platform and to include the best practices of the New England and New York markets. PJM Interconnection, which operates the power grid in parts of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia and Washington, D.C., is the nation's only fully functioning RTO. "The process FERC set in place to establish one RTO in PJM, New York and New England is going to get us where we need to be in terms of having a vibrant wholesale market," Long said. Long said Mirant determined a single Northeast RTO would save more than $440 million annually by eliminating the "artificial borders that now exist between New York, New England and PJM." An administrative law judge, acting as a mediator for FERC, considered three proposals for creating the Northeast RTO. The three plans were proposed by interested parties, including Mirant and Enron, and the region's grid operators - the New York Independent System Operator (ISO) in New York, ISO New England in New England and PJM. Last month, the judge asked the FERC to decide who will govern the Northeast RTO and what the timetable is to put the plan in place. The judge favored a plan put forward by the New York ISO and ISO New England. "If FERC implements the RTO plan proposed by PJM in 2003, consumers could save $1.5 billion ... $440 million a year ... over the New York/New England plan, which would not be implemented until 2006," Long said. Under the PJM plan, PJM would overlay its current market model across the entire region, while adopting some of the best practices of the other markets. "Although nothing is perfect, PJM is widely accepted as the best market in the region. New York and New England, which are younger markets, are still works in progress with some bugs to work out," Enron's Shapiro said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron Seeks Replacement For AGA's Gas Storage Report10/17/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE), the nation's largest natural gas trading company, isn't ready to let the regular report on U.S. natural gas storage inventory die, a company executive said Tuesday. Because the American Gas Association has said it will discontinue its weekly gas storage report at the end of the year, Enron would like to see another organization take over the report, said John Lavorato, president and chief executive of the company's Americas Wholesale Services unit.Speaking at a meeting with analysts, Lavorato said the storage report is important for the gas industry to keep track of industry fundamentals. Without a regular report on storage gas inventory, the gas industry can expect less frequent but greater price changes than seen in the past, he said. The Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration publishes monthly data on gas storage, but the information isn't as timely as data the AGA reports each Wednesday. The EIA issued its latest gas storage report Oct. 9. It showed the amount of gas in storage at the end of July. The data comes from reports filed by operators of gas storage facilities. It also showed estimates of the amount of gas in storage at the end of August and September. Those estimates are generated by a computer model. Wednesday's weekly storage report from the AGA will show estimated inventory as of Oct. 12. The AGA estimate is based on reports from gas storage facilities. That data is then run through an AGA computer model to generate the report. Lavorato said he would like to see the EIA, the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America or consultants like PIRA Energy Group, an international energy consulting firm, take over reports on storage inventory. INGAA is an industry trade group representing gas pipeline companies in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. They manage many of the gas storage facilities. Lavorato would like to see a new report based on data that could be audited, he said. He said he thinks the AGA has found itself "in the middle of something it didn't want to be in." Originally intended for use within the gas industry, the weekly AGA report has become high-profile, and is even watched by equity markets, he said. Some industry participants have criticized the AGA report, wondering whether it can be manipulated by companies that supply data to the AGA. Many of those companies also trade physical gas and gas futures. When the AGA has revised storage figures from previous reports, gas prices have sometimes reacted wildly. -By Michael Rieke, Dow Jones Newswires; 713-547-9207; michael.rieke@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Kelliher's nomination comes as the commission has pledged toclosely monitor and investigate abuses in the electricity andnatural gas markets and promote competition. In the next month orso, it is due to choose which groups will run the electric powergrid around the country, an important step in deregulating thenation's power markets.     A former power industry lobbyist, Kelliher would fill theopening left by the departure of Curt Hebert, a Republicanappointed by President Bill Clinton and named chairman by Bush.Hebert left the commission Aug. 31 to join Entergy Corp. after theWhite House made it clear Bush planned to make Wood the chairman.With Kelliher, FERC will have three Republicans and two Democrats.     ``Kelliher will be a valuable final addition to the team nowworking actively to finish the transition to truly competitive anddynamic power markets,'' said the Electric Power SupplyAssociation, which represents competitive power sellers such asEnron Corp.     The commission is responsible for ensuring fair wholesaleelectricity and natural gas prices.Energy Regulators May Loosen Price Caps on Western Power Sales2001-10-17 14:59 (New York)Energy Regulators May Loosen Price Caps on Western Power Sales     Washington, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Federal regulators areconsidering changes to wholesale price caps on electricity inCalifornia and 10 Western states, which power producers hope willallow them to charge more when supplies in the region are tight.     The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission plans a publicconference Oct. 29 to discuss altering the pricing formula. Thecommission established caps in April and June, after skyrocketingelectricity costs led to insolvency for California's largestutilities, units of PG&E Corp. and Edison International.     ``We have heard and understand that people do think thesolution was very California-centric, and it was,'' FERC ChairmanPat Wood said, indicating changes in the formula are likely. ``ButCalifornia's needs were very urgent at the time.''     While commissioners declined to say what they would bewilling to change about the pricing formula, they want to fine-tune the caps before the winter, which is the peak period ofdemand and may yet cause another jump in prices, Wood said.Changes could be made next month.     The current pricing formula is based on the most-expensivepower generated in California. Enron Corp., Sierra PacificResources and other sellers of power to California want theformula to consider costs from all generators in the region.     Enron blamed the formula for a July 2 blackout in Nevada,when sellers withheld supply because local prices were too lowbased on the highest cost of supply then being offered inCalifornia.                         Lower Power Costs     Though the cost of wholesale power in California has droppedsince the commission ordered the first emergency cap on April 25,Wood said the Western states may face another shortage of powerand high prices this winter.     The Pacific Northwest depends on hydropower for much of itsenergy needs, and rainfall has been below normal this year. Partof the shortfall in power last year and early this year was theresult of a drought that reduced power available from dams.     ``I remain concerned about that part of the country,'' Woodsaid. ``It has not been raining a whole lot out there.''     The average price for a megawatt-hour at the California-Oregon border in September was $24.91, down from $313.70 in April.A megawatt-hour is enough electricity to power about 750 averageCalifornia homes for an hour.     On the agenda for this month's conference is a proposal tolink the formula to the price of natural gas, a fuel used in manygenerating plants.     ``I'm not predisposed for or against specific changes,'' saidFERC Commissioner Nora Brownell. The Oct. 29 conference will helpthe commission determine aspects of the price control that theparties involved agree are working and those that are not, shesaid.                             Surcharge     In a related matter, the commission also may halt the 10percent surcharge it permits generators to charge in California tocover the costs of collecting bad debt. The insolvent Californiautilities now have plans to pay off their debts.     For power sellers in the West, the current price caps oftenrequire utilities to sell their excess power at a loss, Enron,Sierra Pacific and other marketers said in statements to thecommission. They said the price they sometimes pay for power ishigher than the cost of supply from the most-expensive producer inCalifornia.     ``The determination of the proxy price should not be limitedto California generators,'' Enron said in a government filing. Itshould be ``determined by the least-efficient generator in theentire West.''     Power marketers also should be allowed to recover``justifiable costs above the proxy prices,'' Enron wrote.     California officials had demanded the price controls afterPG&E's Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison's Southern CaliforniaEdison racked up more than $14 billion in power-buying losses.     The caps were extended to other Western states -- Oregon,Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado,Montana, Idaho and Utah -- in June because some said generators inthe West could simply get around the cap by selling outsideCalifornia when prices were higher elsewhere. The caps don'texpire until Sept. 30, 2002, though they can be changed.     California said before the price cap was extended to otherstates that it sometimes had to outbid buyers in neighboringstates at prices above the caps to buy enough electricity to avoidblackouts.     On July 2, Sierra Pacific cut supplies to 10,000 customersfor 45 minutes when temperatures soared and three power plantswere idled. It couldn't buy 50 megawatts of power in the spotmarket, partly because of suppliers' concerns with the federalcap, company spokesman Paul Heagan said at the time.Enron Faces Questions Over Limited Partnerships, WSJ Reports2001-10-17 10:11 (New York)     Houston, Oct. 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is facingquestions over agreements with two limited partnerships run by itschief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, the Wall Street Journalreported.     Fastow set up LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP withthe approval of Enron's board. The partnerships have engaged inbillions of dollars of complex hedging transactions with Enroninvolving company assets and Enron stock, the paper said. It isn'tclear from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings whatEnron received in return.     Enron said about $35 million of its $1.01 billion chargereported yesterday was connected with the partnerships andinvolves the ``early termination ... of certain structured financearrangements,'' the paper said. Chief Executive Officer KennethLay said in an earlier interview that related transactionsinvolving top managers aren't unusual, the paper said.     According to the arrangement, the general partner, made up ofFastow and at least one other Enron employee, received amanagement fee of as much as 2 percent annually of the totalamount invested, the paper said, citing the LJM2 offeringdocument. Fastow declined to comment, the paper said.

It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price f=or option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston co=mpany sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled= investors.=20Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet sessio=n Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded =more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Boar=d Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 =p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.Enron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate incom=e. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a thre=e-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on= Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dyn=egy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compar=ed with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.=20For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the "wash =sale" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from =selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring "substantially i=dentical" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This= poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose pri=ces now make them attractive "buy" candidates.=20In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the w=ash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money pu=t, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquir=ed by the investor.=20So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by "doubling up": buyi=ng additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling =the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, w=hich locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying addi=tional stock.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits CrossroadsBy Rebecca Smith and John R. EmshwillerStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal11/23/2001The Wall Street JournalA3(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is= coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the mult=ibillion-dollar deal.=20The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron sh=ares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading comp=any, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During t=he past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised do=wnward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion redu=ction in shareholder equity.The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=y lower, market observers said.=20The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=gy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=ve Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory =approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously= announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enr=on.=20Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk= away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a= drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,= two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685= share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving= the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =Dynegy.=20On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula= price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=ding relatively close to the offering price.=20Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,= would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director= at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than= Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario"= is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15= Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20Such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According= to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the ex=change formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of En=ron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was =above $80 a share.=20In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Go=ldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy=. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts tha=t the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could "recover =the significant business that has been lost" in its giant energy-trading op=erations. "The Enron machine continues to sputter," Mr. Fleischer wrote.=20Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to ren=egotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-l=aw filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its ba=nkers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing "is highly possible,"= said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency=. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one not=ch above noninvestment-grade, or "junk," status. But Fitch also said it bel=ieved Enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral calls"= in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations," contrib=uting to "liquidity pressures."=20Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law fir=m of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-=workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spok=eswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefor=e doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the m=erger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alt=ernatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron sa=id it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said= it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Cit=igroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 bill=ion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repaym=ent of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The sp=okeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be complet=ed next month so that repayment wouldn't be required this year.=20---=20Thaddeus Herrick and Robin Sidel contributed to this article.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Amid growing disclosur=es of financial problems in recent weeks, the company "locked down" the ret=irement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which =prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, becaus=e of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on= Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has bee=n costly to participants in Enron's retirement plan because more than 60% o=f the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, =according to one of the suits.=20The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell= Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesda=y by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.==20Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A sp=okeswoman also said the company's 401(k) plan offers participants 18 invest=ment choices, one of which is company stock.=20The company's stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it= had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed= by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has la=unched a formal investigation into the company's accounting, and Enron has =said it will restate years of financial information.=20The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against c=ompanies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. Th=e suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continu=ing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious busines=s problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.=20As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to th=e 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an inve=stment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion= of the plan's $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the e=nd of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.=20Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance d=epartment and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harriso=n & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement accou=nt and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock's dec=line. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated =their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company =stock was in peril.=20The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to wa=rn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In additi=on, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial result=s since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the= SEC.=20Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in th=e suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fa=ll to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron's =stock. "I feel like I have been betrayed," Mr. Rinard said in press release= issued by his lawyers. "I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everyt=hing."=20Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock i=n retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the sto=ck. Enron doesn't let employees diversify out of shares they receive as mat=ching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.=20However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interes=ts of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Genera=lly, to prove that the plan's administrators breached their fiduciary dutie=s, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investmen=t. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits= over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wa=ke of allegations of accounting irregularities.=20Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle's attorneys with Seattle's Keller Rohrback LL=P, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies= Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Got=to Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ik=on Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing M=s. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright.=20The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that= then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite= knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Repr=esentatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn't require employee=s to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for= diversification.=20The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day afte=r Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.=01 billion in the third quarter, Enron "locked down" the 401(k) plan's asse=ts, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A "lock-down" occur=s when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, =and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can't mak=e changes in their investment choices).=20The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron annou=nced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results =from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result o=f all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.=20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth s=aid.=20"They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announci=ng some really bad news," Mr. Barth said. "Mr. Rinard's looking at having n=o retirement savings now. It's a horrible thing to have to start over in yo=ur 50s."Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The Securities =and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen p=artner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Managem=ent case.=20Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Ar=thur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from= the company's reported profits in recent years.All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black shee=p of the accounting industry?=20It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush t=o judgment. ''If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know mo=re than we know,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and= Exchange Commission, said this week.=20But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it= is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounti=ng but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahea=d.=20Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into= trouble. The idea is that it doesn't much matter if a few little things we=re gotten wrong. But they can add up.=20At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 milli=on over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a rel=ated party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not cle=ar if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.=20To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is =painful. Back in the 1950's, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen's managing par=tner, who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it= was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in ma=king the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the t=able was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to= break with clients and push for good rules.=20Now Andersen's backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior pe=ople at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that =led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without a=dmitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looke=d the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says h=e acted properly.=20Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now =director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State Un=iversity, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what hap=pened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a s=eries of highly publicized blown audits.=20''We got bludgeoned to death in the press,'' he said. ''People did not even= want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We h=ad gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls=.'' By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending= clients and not enough to good accounting.=20For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph= Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to se=t a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the =backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the =public of that.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09Business/Financial Desk; Section CChase and J. P.

P. Morgan combination helped advance the bank into the investm=ent banking elite, just as Mr. Harrison intended. But with Wall Street and =the economy in far different places today than they were when the deal was =put together, the many mergers, stock sales and other money-making opportun=ities that were supposed to justify the high-priced acquisition have largel=y dried up for now.=20Consequently, deal makers and analysts who follow the bank are already spec=ulating that Mr. Harrison, 58, may ultimately be compelled to do yet anothe=r large deal, this time to diversify his business away from its heavy empha=sis on Wall Street.=20J.

Morgan Chase has been scrambling to maintain the support of =other banks while simultaneously keeping the merger with Dynegy on track.==20Thanks largely to the slump on Wall Street, J. P. Morgan Chase's profits fe=ll by two-thirds in the third quarter, to $449 million from $1.4 billion in= the period a year ago. Its stock has dropped 15 percent this year, more th=an other banks' shares. The bank's stock is ahead of investment banks like =Goldman Sachs, with which J. P. Morgan Chase increasingly competes.=20''The jury is still out in many respects on this merger,'' said Judah Kraus=haar, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. Nevertheless, he likes J. P. Morgan Chas=e's stock, he said, because ''expectations are very low.''=20All J. P. Morgan Chase's competitors are suffering from the slowdown on Wal=l Street. But some, like Citigroup, are better diversified and have greater= involvement in old-fashioned consumer banking, which is proving to be a st=rong moneymaker this year.=20Nearly a third of J. P. Morgan Chase's revenues are consumer-oriented. By c=ontrast, its chief New York rival, Citigroup, gets half its revenues from c=onsumer businesses.=20''The timing of the merger was bad,'' said Steven Wharton, a banking analys=t at Loomis, Sayles & Company, which owns about a million J. P. Morgan Chas=e shares. ''There's no disputing that.''=20Actually, Mr. Harrison disputes it. ''I can't tell you how happy I am about= having done this merger,'' he said in a recent interview. ''While there ar=e pluses and minuses to operating in a weak economic environment, we have a= much stronger platform to manage with during this difficult time.''=20In Mr. Harrison's favor is his battle-tested team of top executives who hav=e worked together for a decade or more. Few executives remain in the top sp=ots from the old J. P. Morgan. Instead, most major posts are filled by mana=gers who have worked with Mr. Harrison since his days at Chemical Bank, whe=re he spent most of his career. Mr. Harrison's team successfully gobbled up= Manufacturers Hanover Bank in 1991, then followed that with Chemical's mer=ger with Chase Manhattan in 1996 before incorporating Morgan into the fold =last year.=20The group of Chemical veterans includes Marc J. Shapiro, who oversees finan=ce and risk management at J. P. Morgan Chase; Donald H. Layton, one of two =leaders of investment banking; and James B. Lee Jr., the bank's senior deal= maker. The team also includes Dina Dublon, the bank's chief financial offi=cer.=20Two other senior executives have also lived through big deals. Geoffrey T. =Boisi, the other investment banking leader, was the one-time investment ban=king chief at Goldman, Sachs. David A. Coulter, in charge of Chase's retail= bank, had been chief executive of Bank of America before it was bought by =NationsBank.=20''There aren't many teams that have gone through as many mergers as Bill Ha=rrison and his team,'' said Mark G. Solow, managing principal at GarMark Ad=visors, an investment firm, and a former senior executive at Chemical.=20Still, Ms. Dublon acknowledged that the tough economy was making the J. P. =Morgan takeover more difficult than the earlier combinations.=20''In general, mergers are very hard on morale,'' she said. ''There is no qu=estion that this one has a tougher emotional toll.''=20The bank's executives are making the best of a bad situation. They have tak=en advantage of the slowdown to cut around 8 percent of the combined banks'= staff, or about 2,500 more employees than anticipated at the time the merg=er was announced.=20Many of these job cuts were aimed at high-cost investment bankers: J. P. Mo=rgan Chase expects that 6,000 jobs in its investment banking division will =have been eliminated by the end of the year.=20''We have focused on the tougher jobs to cut,'' Ms. Dublon said.=20In some ways the overall market turmoil has made it easier for J. P. Morgan= Chase to overhaul its staff. With fewer jobs available on Wall Street, Mr.= Shapiro said, the employees who are left behind are less apt to complain a=bout changes in their jobs. ''People have fewer options,'' he said, ''so yo=u have a little more control over the process.''=20Thanks partly to these cuts, the bank estimates the saving from cost cuttin=g will be $3.6 billion annually, compared with an original projection of $2= billion at the time of the merger.=20The cost cutting has helped compensate somewhat for a sharp drop in profits= in the bank's core businesses. ''What we can control and are managing very= aggressively is the expenses of the company,'' Ms. Dublon said in a confer=ence call with reporters on Oct. 17, the day earnings were announced.=20Aside from cost cuts, the weakness on Wall Street makes it hard for the ban=k's executives to point to tangible gains in investment banking, where fees= were down 24 percent in the third quarter. But Mr. Harrison points to mark=et-share gains the bank has achieved at the expense of competitors on Wall =Street. He hopes that when the investment banking business revives, J. P. M=organ Chase will hold on to these gains.=20The bank is particularly proud of its standing in two areas: mergers and ac=quisitions, and the underwriting of large investment-grade bond deals.=20The bank ranked 5th worldwide in the highly profitable category of advising= on mergers during the first nine months of 2001, up from Chase's 12th-plac=e finish and J. P. Morgan's 10th-place standing during the same period last= year, according to Thomson Financial Securities data.=20The merger and acquisitions business, which Chase had been slowly building =for years, is stronger following the merger with J. P. Morgan, said Mr. Lee=, a vice chairman at the bank. As a result, the bank is able to win assignm=ents providing advice to customers who dealt with the old Chase only for lo=ans.=20Mr. Lee remains proud of the bank's work with Enron, the energy company, de=spite its troubles. J. P. Morgan Chase, along with Citigroup, raised $1 bil=lion in bank financing for Enron earlier this month. It was also hired to a=dvise the company, which hopes to be saved from collapse by being taken ove=r by Dynegy.=20The old Chase, long a lending powerhouse, would have had a good shot at lea=ding the bank financing, but an advisory role would have been less certain.= Mr. Lee said the investment banker advising Enron came from the old J. P. =Morgan. But with merger activity slow, there are few such deals to go aroun=d.=20The bank is also proud of its strength in long-term investment-grade bonds,= another area that business executives say has been enhanced by the merger.= It moved up to second place in that area so far this year, compared with s=ixth place a year ago.=20The bank has taken advantage of a boom in large corporate bond offerings, a= surge driven by today's low interest rates. In May J. P. Morgan Chase rais=ed $12 billion in bonds for WorldCom, the telecommunications company, in th=e largest corporate debt deal in the United States on record.=20Unfortunately for J. P. Morgan Chase, the fees for underwriting investment-=grade debt are small compared with the money to be earned coordinating offe=rings of stock, where J. P. Morgan Chase remains a second-tier competitor.==20The bank actually lost market share in the rankings for underwriters of sto=ck, falling to 9th place this year, compared with the old J. P. Morgan's 6t=h-place finish a year ago. (Chase was 11th.)=20Mr. Harrison said the bank was taking advantage of the slowdown in stock of=ferings to build momentum slowly in that business. ''We think we have a cha=nce in the second half of this year to be in the top five,'' he said.=20Given the slowdown, some bankers predict that Mr. Harrison will ultimately =do another deal, either to expand his consumer banking business or to bolst=er weak areas in investment banking, like the equity division.=20''The general view is that the combination with J. P. Morgan didn't do enou=gh,'' one investment banker said.=20Mr. Harrison disagrees: ''I don't feel,'' he said, ''we need to do another =large deal to be successful.''Photo: William B. Harrison Jr., the chief executive, says he has no doubts =about the wisdom of forming J. P. Morgan Chase, even though the the economy= has slowed since then. ''I can't tell you how happy I am about having done= this merger,'' he said. (Associated Press) Chart: ''Still Looking for the =Right Mix'' When J. P.

That wa=s followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices =were headed down, not up.=20And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the= industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE).=20Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high g=as prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters.=20The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth sto=cks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about =where traditional utilities trade.=20And the chance for recovery in 2002?=20Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is w=illing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same =price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is current=ly between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of =time before the stocks get there.=20"They were just recovering from Gray Davis," Mullick said, referring to the= governor of California, who had accused "out-of-state" energy traders of a=rtificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the s=tate's energy crisis. "Now, they are recovering from Enron."=20The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor =demand for the recent weak performance in the group.=20"Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates," he sai=d. "I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety ut=ility."=20Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions bet=ween the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategie=s and financial disclosures.=20Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accoun=ting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the =fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention= paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatilit=y it can create.=20Answers Elude Investors=20Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers the=y want.=20Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of= a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - =at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer pe=riod. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes fr=om the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its o=riginal assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair val=ue of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where =the market for the commodity isn't liquid.=20Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their m=ark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterpa=rts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul P=atterson.=20Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call f=or added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more compan=ies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their= mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls =compared with those in the second quarter.=20Patterson said he prefers earnings that are cash-based.=20"All things being equal, we believe reported earnings that more closely ref=lect the timely realization of cash have a higher quality associated with t=hem than earnings that do not," he said.=20He expects investors to become smarter and learn to distinguish between ear=nings growth through accrual accounting and growth fueled by mark-to-market= accounting.=20At the end of the day, it is not a matter of simply producing profits, but =being able to say where those earnings came from, said one investor, who ma=nages a pension fund.=20Some investors also may be placing a greater emphasis on the cash flow the =energy merchants produce.=20Tim O'Brien, portfolio manager of the Gabelli Utilities Fund, said energy m=erchants that own the physical power assets to back up their trading positi=ons should trade at a premium to an independent power producers and traditi=onal utility companies.

It is also exploring the idea of alliances with oth=er exchanges, and considering developing "e-mini" contracts - smaller energ=y contracts for Internet-based trade by retail investors.=20"There's new management in place at the exchange," said Nymex spokeswoman N=achamah Jacobovits. "They're rethinking all of our business strategies, and= one very massive strategy was the idea of this major eNymex B2B (business-=to-business) system launch with a whole new slate of products."=20Nymex and GlobalView Software Inc., a company that initially worked on buil=ding the eNymex trading system, have sued each other in a dispute over work= on the project.=20Kiodex, an electronic-trading technology firm that has developed the back e=nd of the eNymex system, took on added development work for the project aft=er GlobalView departed. The trade engine Kiodex was asked to build is "subs=tantially complete, but the company can't speak to Nymex's overall electron=ic-trading strategy," a Kiodex source said.=20The eNymex platform was conceived as a forum for trading over-the-counter e=nergy products, but Nymex has already moved ahead with plans for trading so=me of them on Access, initially an overnight trading system that was expand=ed in September. It hopes, for example, to launch gas swaps based on delive=ry at the Henry Hub within the next six weeks on Access, Jacobovits said.==20"We've expedited plans for a Henry Hub natural gas swap contract," Jacobovi=ts said. "Traders could be looking for OTC clearing on a neutral-based plat=form, which is a factor in that decision."=20Before Sept. 14, Access was used only to trade energy futures at night, aft=er the day's Nymex session had ended. Use was limited to Nymex members with= dedicated phone systems.=20The exchange had been planning to expand use of Access, but ended up doing =so sooner than it had expected. On Sept. 14, it started offering Access tra=ding over the Internet, a move that will eventually allow Nymex to open up =trade to more users.=20The move was intended to help keep futures markets liquid after the Sept. 1=1 attack on the World Trade Center. Nymex's building, located near where th=e trade towers stood, was shut down for several days after the attacks. Exp=anding its already existent Access system to the Internet helped ease poten=tial liquidity problems that could have arisen from shortened floor trading= hours after Nymex reopened.=20Development of the eNymex system began last year under the direction of for=mer Nymex Chairman Daniel Rappaport. In August, Nymex said it would launch =the eNymex platform within four to eight months. New Nymex President J. Rob=ert "Bo" Collins Jr. said then that vendor problems had slowed development =of the system's front-end technology and caused the delays. But he still ex=pected eNymex to launch without any meaningful changes to its original prod=uct line.=20If Nymex combines parts or all of the platform originally intended as eNyme=x with Access, the new system may end up being known as eNymex.=20"eNymex right now is looking for a new mission," said an industry source cl=ose to Nymex. "You know how politics works. We don't scrap it, we just rena=me it. Anything we do electronically is now going to be called eNymex. But =the original deal and concept that Rappaport initiated is done."=20Nymex's reconsideration comes as the energy-trading world undergoes rapid c=hange. The two most successful online energy trading platforms -- Enron Cor=p.'s (ENE) EnronOnline, and IntercontinentalExchange, or ICE -- have seen t=heir luck turn - in opposite directions.=20Enron Corp. (ENE), which accounts for about 25% of the trade in U.S. power =and gas markets, faces questions about its creditworthiness as the Securiti=es and Exchange Commission investigates complicated financial dealings. Enr=on's possible merger with Dynegy Inc. (DYN), now appears to be in doubt, an=d energy trading companies are pulling back their exposure to the company.==20Enron executes about 60% of its power and gas trades on EnronOnline. When E=nron's troubles surfaced last month, Nymex quickly moved to extend its clea=ring services to over-the-counter natural gas derivatives, a move the tradi=ng community saw as an attempt to grab market share.=20ICE, on the other hand, is moving ahead with plans to capture more energy t=rade on its electronic format. ICE closed a deal this summer to acquire the= London-based International Petroleum Exchange - Nymex's chief competitor a=nd Europe's largest traditional energy exchange. It plans to move all IPE e=nergy contracts to its Internet-based system and offer clearing services fo=r some over-the-counter contracts.=20Nymex is exploring alliances that could give it a better footing in the new= competitive landscape. One idea under review is a joint venture with the C=hicago Mercantile Exchange to offer e-mini contracts for Nymex products on =CME's Globex electronic-trading system, the person close to Nymex said.=20Nymex officials wouldn't confirm whether they're talking with the CME, but =they said the relationship between the exchanges is a warm one.=20"Nymex is always open to strategic alliances," Jacobovits said. "There's no=thing we've agreed to at this point, but we have open dialogue with a numbe=r of exchanges concerning strategic alliances. We have a good relationship =with the Chicago Merc, and we certainly would be open to working with them.="=20Shortly after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York shut down the Nyme=x trading floor, the CME said it would be willing to offer Nymex products o=n its Globex system until Nymex resumed operations, Jacobovits said.=20-By Stephen Parker, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-4426; stephen.parker@dowjo=nes.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs.Continental announced a layoff of 3,000 employees after the Sept. 11 attack=s and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. will, if fina=lized, result in 15,000 layoffs at the two companies. Compaq also announced= 8,000 layoffs worldwide in July.=20"It's fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Co=ntinental, taken alone, are negative factors, although probably small in th=e grand scope of the Houston economy," said Phil Scheps, director of Housto=n's finance and administration department.=20Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Co=mmission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships, the energ=y giant's market share has steadily eroded.=20While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of l=ayoffs that could hit Houston, Barton Smith, director of the Institute for =Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston, said the layoffs "will b=e spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive."=20Robin Kapiloff, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said the city's ef=forts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenu=e collections, even as some of the city's biggest employers suffer. "We're =watching to see where things go now," she said.=20Alex Fraser, a director at Standard & Poor's, said the ratings agency isn't= concerned about Houston's credit position at this point. "While Enron is c=ertainly a large player and prominent corporation, we're unclear on what th=e impact would be."=20While the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdow=n since the Sept. 11 attacks, Houston has outperformed the rest of the nati=on.=20With a tax base of $87.3 billion in 2001, Houston is also buffered by the T=exas Medical Center, the city's largest employer. Next year the city's tax =base is estimated to grow to $95 billion.=20Still, the national recession, energy price weakness in general, and the in=itial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the cit=y to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1.5 percent from 5 percent.= That revised estimate equals a $13 million reduction in the city's $1.4 bi=llion budget.=20But the city's property tax revenue has not been affected. Only a small cha=nge in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are =based on Jan. 1 data and for most of 2001, real estate growth was very larg=e, Scheps said.=20While recent economic indicators appear positive, and consumer confidence h=as quickly rebounded, a better read on the strength of Houston's tax revenu=e collections will be available in February when the city receives data for= the December holiday season, Scheps said.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Du=ring the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revi=sed downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billio=n reduction in shareholder equity.The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partn=erships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Secu=rities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hu=ndreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possib=ility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more t=han $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.=20As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron =shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. =In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the =volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharpl=y lower, market observers said.=20The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most a=ctively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dyne=gy (DYN) shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.=20On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executi=ve Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory =approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously= announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enr=on.=20Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk= away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe e=nough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-=called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier th=is year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to c=omplete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark=., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a= drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.=20Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal,= two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders wou=ld have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.=20One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enr=on contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives =planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new i=nformation as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It cou=ldn't be determined what the new information was.=20The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685= share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving= the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. =However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to =Dynegy.=20On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $=8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As =of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula= price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announceme=nt, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins tra=ding relatively close to the offering price.=20Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. In=itially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron =and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officia=ls have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year,= would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.=20Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director= at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial pro=blems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than= Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario"= is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15= Dynegy share for each Enron share.=20Copyright (c) 2001 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.=20All Rights Reserved.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares and bondsfell for a third day on concern the company's weakened financialcondition and plunging stock price may lead Dynegy Inc. to try tocancel or rework a takeover of the biggest energy trader.     Shares of Enron, the most-active U.S. stock, dropped30 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.71. They fell 45 percent Tuesday andWednesday after Enron said it may have to pay more than $9 billionin debt due by 2003. Enron 6.4 percent bonds due in July 2006 werebid at 55 cents on the dollar, down from 62 cents on Wednesday,traders said.     Enron shares are trading at less than half the value ofDynegy's offer, which shows investors are questioning whether thebuyout will be completed on the terms agreed to two weeks ago.Enron's financial woes may prove to be a drag on Dynegy's earningsnext year if the transaction is completed, analysts said.     ``There are continued doubts about the deal,'' said UBSWarburg analyst Ronald Barone, who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy''and doesn't own shares in either company. ``Enron's earningsaren't what they used to be because they've lost trading business.Given that, Dynegy has an opportunity to renegotiate the price.''     Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the company ``remainsoptimistic for the potential of the merger.'' Enron agreed Nov. 9to the takeover, now valued at about $23 billion in stock andassumed debt, after a financial crisis threatened it withbankruptcy.     On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from lenders ona $690 million note due next week, giving the company more time torestructure its finances. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer ChuckWatson said he was ``encouraged'' by the commitment to extend thenote payment, as well as the closing of a $450 million creditfacility, and that Dynegy remained committed to the purchase.     More than 40 million Enron shares changed hands today, almosttwice their three-month daily average, in a session shortenedbecause of the Thanksgiving holiday. Enron was the most-activeU.S. stock on Wednesday, with 116 million shares traded. Dynegyshares rose 64 cents to $40.40 today.                       Less Than $2 Billion     In a Securities & Exchange Commission filing Monday, Enronsaid it has less than $2 billion in cash and credit lines left. Ifthe company's cash reserves run too low, Enron is in danger ofseeing its credit rating cut below investment grade. That wouldtrigger $3.9 billion in debt repayments for two affiliatedpartnerships.     Enron's bankers have met with unidentified investors,including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, ina bid to shore up the energy trader's finances with an injectionof as much as $2 billion, the New York Times reported yesterday,citing unidentified executives close to the companies.     Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said the company is seeking$500 million to $1 billion. Enron needs to raise $1 billion to$1.5 billion in cash within the next 45 days, said Sean Egan,managing director of Egan-Jones Rating Co.     ``Their trading operation has burned through cash faster thanthe market had expected,'' Egan said.                         Trading Business     Traders including Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. have said theyshifted transactions away from Enron after its plunging stockprice prompted concerns about creditworthiness. Enron has saidfourth-quarter earnings would be reduced partly by a drop in itsenergy-trading business.     Watson said after the Enron buyout was announced he expectedit to increase 2002 earnings by 35 percent. Analysts said thatcan't happen unless Enron recovers lost trading business. Severalhave cut their 2002 estimates for Enron. The average estimate ofanalysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call for next year isnow $1.68 a share, down from $2.14 a month ago.     Dynegy can cancel or renegotiate if Enron can't meet debtpayments, its trading market collapses, banks demand morecollateral or raise the interest rate for loans, Enron's creditrating is cut to junk, the SEC cites Enron for securities fraud,or if Enron's legal liabilities including shareholder suits exceed$3.5 billion, Egan said.                     Will Dynegy Renegotiate?     Dynegy officials were considering whether to try andrenegotiate terms of its agreement with Enron, according to theNew York Times report. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston.     ``Dynegy investors would like to see the company negotiate alower price for Enron,'' said Credit Lyonnais securities analystGordon Howald, who rates Dynegy ``buy'' and owns no shares.     Under the Nov. 9 terms, Enron investors would receive 0.2685Dynegy share for each share held. At today's closing price, thatvalues Enron stock at $10.85. A year ago, Enron traded at almost$80.     Investors worry that a cancellation of the merger would pushEnron into bankruptcy.     ``The market is saying there seems to be no obvious Plan Bfor Enron and that is what has investors concerned,'' said EricBergson, who helps manage $9 billion of fixed-income assets atNorthern Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The lower bond prices go, whatthe market is saying is that there's less chance of this dealgoing through.''--Jim Polson in Princeton, (609) 750-4658 or jpolson@Bloomberg.netKKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says2001-11-23 16:20 (New York)KKR, Blackstone Are Among Likely Enron Investors, Analyst Says     Houston, Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts &Co., the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group are among thelikely candidates to be approached by Enron Corp. for a privateequity investment to shore up the company's balance sheet, saidindustry analyst David Snow of PrivateEquityCentral.Net.     The firms have cash on hand and have invested in energycompanies in the past. An investment in Enron may look attractivenow that its shares have plunged by 94 percent this year.     ``Many of the larger, more traditional buyout firms wouldfind this deal attractive,'' said Snow. ``This is a company thathas real assets that is down in the dumps and has need of capitalwhen capital is scarce.''     Enron's bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms andtwo industrial companies to seek an investment, the New York Timesreported, citing executives close to the companies. Enron's stockfell for a fifth day in six on concern the company's weakenedfinancial condition may lead Dynegy Inc. to try to cancel orrework its planned purchase of the rival Houston company.     Investors may inject as much as $2 billion under arrangementsthat would protect them from further declines in Enron's stock,the Times said. The new investments would be in Enron'sTranswestern Pipeline, which connects natural-gas fields in Texasto the California market, the newspaper said.     J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. agreed to termsthat give each of them a $250 million equity stake as part of atransaction to be completed Monday, officials told the newspaper.     Buyout firms sometimes make collective bids, pooling theirmoney and distributing the risk. The firms also like to invest inindustries that are out of favor with public investors and to doso in partnership with corporate investors, like Dynegy, saidSnow.     ``You need to know enough about the (energy) business to knowwhether it's a good deal, and then you need to be confident in theDynegy team,'' he said.                                KKR     KKR, the second-biggest private equity firm with $24 billionin assets, declined comment on Enron through spokeswoman MollyMorse of Kekst & Co.     The New York-based firm invested more than $1.3 billion inDPL Inc., a utility in Dayton, Ohio, and will receive $550 millionof that back from the company after DPL sold $700 million of bondsin August.     ``KKR very much gets involved in deals where there's acorporate partner and they don't have a majority stake,'' Snowsaid. ``They would possibly hold it for years, because they likeslow exits.'' KKR is also a possible candidate because it recentlyraised a new $5 billion buyout fund.     Any LBO firm would need assurance about how it will get itsmoney back on an Enron investment, said Snow.     ``The thing they have to be cautious about is the exit,'' hesaid. ``If there's a chance Dynegy would agree to buy out (the LBOfirms') stake over time, that would give some confidence. But ifthe only exit is the public market, that's a little bit dicier.''     Any private investment also must be large enough to make ameaningful difference: Enron's market value is $3.7 billion andDynegy has proposed paying $23 billion in stock and assumption ofdebt. That means the private equity portion would have to approach$1 billion or more.     The 20 largest private equity firms have assets of more than$5 billion under management each, according to Asset Alternatives,a Wellesley, Massachusetts industry research firm. Still, many ofthose firms don't have enough free capital to undertake aninvestment of $500 million or more.     An announcement of an investment may come soon, analysts say.Energy trading firms such as Mirant Corp. and Aquila Inc. aredoing fewer trades with Enron because of concern that the companywon't be able to finance its business. Enron shares have fallen byalmost half in the past three sessions.     ``They're going to need this investment within 30 to 45days,'' said Sean Egan of Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``They'respiraling downward and they're going to need some more beyond the$1.5 billion contributed by'' ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26percent of Dynegy.                            Other LBOs     Here's a rundown of the other most likely private equitypartners for Enron:     --The Carlyle Group could invest through a $1 billion energyfund it's raising, as well as its general U.S. buyout fund, saidSnow. Carlyle's vice president for corporate communications, ChrisUllman, declined to comment.     --Blackstone, which has a history of investing alongsideother corporate partners, recently closed on a $4 billion buyoutfund. Blackstone spokesman John Ford declined to comment onwhether Enron had approached the firm.     --Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst, which is based in Texas likeDynegy and Enron. Hicks Muse counts Triton Energy Ltd., an energyexploration company, among its best investments. The firm recentlyraised about $1.5 billion for new investments, about one-third ofwhat it had hoped to raise, and has said it will focus on ``back-to-basics'' investments in food, manufacturing and media. MarkSemer, a spokesman for Hicks Muse who also works for Kekst,declined comment on Enron.     Spokesmen for two other firms, Warburg Pincus & Co. andCredit Suisse First Boston's private equity arm, didn't returncalls seeking comment.--Randy Whitestone in the New York newsroom (212) 940-1805=20Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit2001-11-23 11:59 (New York)Microsoft MSN Fast Web Access Expansion Slowed by Enron Suit     Redmond, Washington Nov. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp.'splans to expand its MSN high-speed Internet service have beendelayed by a lawsuit from Enron Corp., which could cost thecompany customers during the holiday season, analysts said.     MSN had planned to have fast Internet access over telephonelines available, with help from energy trader Enron, in 45 marketsstarting Oct. 25. Instead, the service is now on sale in about 30markets, said MSN Product Manager Lisa Gurry.     The latest delay follows a string of apparent bad luck thathas delayed the rollout of Microsoft's fast Internet accessservice over the last year. The holidays are typically a populartime for customers to buy so-called broadband access, often alongwith new personal computers purchased or received as gifts.     ``They have a track record of picking broadband partners thatdon't quite work out,'' said Joe Laszlo, senior analyst at marketresearcher Jupiter Media Metrix Inc. ``It definitely hurts themwith customers who want broadband right now.''     Subscribers to fast Internet access services are expected togrow fourfold by 2006, according to estimates by Jupiter MediaMetrix, while sales of slower Internet access plans decline. FastInternet service over phone lines uses digital subscriber line, orDSL, technology.                         On Track     Gurry said Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is still ontrack to have fast access for sale by the end of March to 90percent of the 45 million to 50 million households that have DSLavailable in their neighborhoods.     ``There is very little growth left in the dial-up accessspace for Microsoft or anybody, which leaves them with broadbandas the only potential growth area for the MSN access business,''said Youssef Squali, an analyst at FAC/Equities, who ratesMicrosoft Internet competitor AOL Time Warner Inc. a ``buy.''     Microsoft also wants to deliver consumer services like musicand video and software updates, which require fast Internet accessfor smooth downloads.     The company originally began a service with NorthPointCommunications Group Inc., a now-bankrupt provider of fast Webaccess. Microsoft has also had difficulty finding partners amongcable companies who use their networks for high-speed service.     Now Houston-based Enron, which agreed in June to provide thebackbone for a nationwide expansion of MSN's service, is suing.Enron claimed in its lawsuit that it isn't required to deliverbroadband services if Microsoft hasn't first provided a billingand ordering system that the biggest software company agreed tobuild.     Enron, which is being acquired by rival Dynegy Inc., recentlydisclosed debts of $9.15 billion due by 2003 and restated earningsfor four years.                        Slower Expansion     MSN has been selling high-speed access in 14 states underpartnership with Qwest Communications International Inc. for thelast few months. MSN has begun the planned service expansionoutside of those states by working with Enron competitors that MSNMarketing Director Bob Visse declined to name. The company is alsotalking to Enron, he said. Enron didn't return calls for comment.     Because of the Enron suit the expansion is moving slower thanexpected, Visse said. Since Oct. 25, MSN has added service in LosAngeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento, California, andHouston, Dallas, San Antonio and Austin, Texas, giving Microsoft atotal of about 30 markets rather than 45. Plans to expandmarketing are also on hold, Visse said.     ``It is very unfortunate that we are in the position we arein,'' said Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.     Top U.S. Internet service provider America Online, owned byAOL Time Warner Inc., has also been slow to get into the high-speed market, analysts said.     That doesn't mean Microsoft is in the clear. Laszlo said bothMSN and AOL might pay for their sluggishness with toughercompetition from third-place EarthLink Inc. and from cable andtelephone companies that have more experience selling high-speedInternet access.     America Online has more than 31 million subscribers to MSN's7 million. EarthLink Inc. has 4.77 million subscribers. Laszlodoesn't think MSN or America Online can build the kind of lead inthe high-speed market that America Online has in the slower dial-up access market.                       `Not a Permanent Blow'     Not that anyone need worry about Microsoft. MSN will be ableto expand its fast Internet access business even with the delays,Laszlo said.     ``They are already late in the broadband market so this meansthey get a little later,'' he said. ``But broadband will continueto grow over the next few years and this is definitely not apermanent blow.''     Analysts also say Microsoft still needs to find a cablepartner that will let MSN use its network to sell fast access overcable lines. Cable is more popular than DSL with customers lookingfor fast Web service. The five largest cable providers control 51percent of the U.S. high-speed Internet market. The five largestsellers of access via phone lines and DSL technology account forabout 33 percent, according to market researcher ARS Inc.     Microsoft MSN Vice President Yusuf Mehdi said last month thecompany may be interested in an investment in AT&T Corp.'s cable-television unit, which AT&T is considering selling. Ballmerdeclined to comment on Microsoft's plans.--Dina Bass in Seattle (206) 521-5981, or dbass2@bloomberg.netMetropolitan Desk; Section ACorrections11/22/2001The New York TimesPage 2, Column 4c. 2001 New York Times CompanyBecause of an editing error, an article in World Business yesterday about t=he Enron Corporation's prospects for selling its interest in the Dabhol Pow=er project in India misstated the size of its stake.

But in the wake of post-agree=ment disclosures by Enron that its future earnings are likely to be substan=tially less than expected, the company's stock has been hammered. In 1 p.m.= trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday, Enron shares fell 30 cen=ts to $4.71. The stock is down 94% so far this year and far short of the pe=r-share takeover price. Dynegy shares rose 64 cents to $40.40.Although Dynegy and Enron both say they are going ahead with the deal under= the terms negotiated, Dynegy does appear to have other options. The agreem=ent with Enron contains a broad "material adverse change" clause as well as= some specific trigger points that could be invoked.=20Dynegy officials performed "due diligence" throughout the holiday weekend, =seeking to learn more about the intimate workings of Enron, which has suffe=red a series of damaging blows. Since mid-October, Enron has disclosed that= some of its officers participated in personally enriching deals that moved= assets off Enron's balance sheet, for a time, to several private partnersh=ips. Those deals are now the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commissio=n investigation. Past treatment of some of those deals has been termed an "=accounting error" by Enron and it twice has rejiggered its earnings since O=ct. 16. At one point, Enron restated downwards nearly five years of earning=s.=20An Enron spokeswoman said the company was proceeding in the belief that the= deal would be completed as agreed. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said the tw=o sides are forging ahead although he acknowledged that the walk-away provi=sions "are broad, by design, to ensure adequate protection for Dynegy share=holders." Shareholders of both firms must still vote on the merger agreemen=t.=20Clauses related to a "material adverse change," also known as a "material a=dverse effect," have been the focus of much attention among merger professi=onals this year, due, in part, to the stock market's fluctuations and the e=conomic slowdown that have caused some buyers to reconsider planned acquisi=tions.=20But such clauses rarely are invoked by a buyer or seller because they are c=onsidered extremely difficult to prove. Both parties typically are reluctan=t to lay out specific terms for canceling a deal, much the way a bride and =groom often balk at negotiating a prenuptial agreement since it appears to =envisage a breakup of the marriage even before it begins.=20Furthermore, a key court case earlier this year affirmed widespread views t=hat a buyer can't easily walk away from a merger. In that case, meat-proces=sing concern Tyson Foods Inc. sought to cancel a planned acquisition of mea=t-packer IBP Inc. due to a drop in IBP's earnings and a write-down of an IB=P subsidiary. But a Delaware judge refused to let Tyson cancel the pact, sa=ying Tyson had been aware of the cyclical nature of IBP's business and the =accounting issue.=20In a lengthy June 18 opinion, Delaware Chancery Court Vice Chancellor Leo E=. Strine Jr. wrote that " . . . the important thing is whether the company =has suffered a Material Adverse Effect in its business or results of operat=ions that is consequential to the company's earnings power over a commercia=lly reasonable period, which one would think would be measured in years rat=her than months."=20That interpretation has created ripples in the deal-making community, promp=ting some transactions to include more details about circumstances under wh=ich deals can be terminated. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, a han=dful of merger agreements have specified that future terrorist activity wou=ld qualify as a "material adverse change," or MAC.=20A key issue for any firm alleging there has been a material adverse change =is "whether the new facts go to the guts of the strategic opportunity or is= it just a hiccup," says Meredith Brown, co-chairman of the mergers and acq=uisitions group at law firm Debevoise & Plimpton in New York. He adds that =a court "may be skeptical" if Dynegy claimed that Enron's post-merger agree=ment disclosures were a surprise.=20The Enron-Dynegy merger agreement includes several triggers permitting eith=er side to seek termination. Enron can quit the deal if it receives a subst=antially better offer, although it is prohibited from soliciting one. In su=ch a case, it could be required to pay a $350 million "topper fee" to Dyneg=y and its co-investor, ChevronTexaco Inc.=20Dynegy can alter the deal if Enron faces "pending or threatened" litigation= liabilities that are "reasonably likely" to cost Enron $2 billion. If thos=e liabilities hit $3.5 billion "an Enron material event will be deemed to h=ave occurred," presumably allowing Dynegy to call the whole thing off. In s=ome situations, Dynegy would be liable for a $350 million fee, as well.=20Karen Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said her firm doesn't believe that loss=es arising from the normal course of business would qualify as a material e=vent. The liability must result from litigation. Currently, the company fac=es more than a dozen shareholder suits alleging breach of fiduciary duty by= officers and directors, issuing false and misleading reports and other off=enses.=20Deal makers who aren't involved in the combination say the steep drop in En=ron's stock price since the merger agreement was signed wouldn't by itself =give Dynegy the ability to cancel the pact or force Enron to renegotiate it=s terms. Instead, they say, Dynegy would likely have to prove that Enron's =worsening financial condition was an unanticipated event, which could be di=fficult in light of the company's highly publicized problems and Dynegy's f=requent statement that it clearly understands Enron's businesses. Still, th=ere is another standard clause in the merger document that would allow Dyne=gy to terminate the deal if "any representation or warranty of Enron shall =have become untrue."=20Other energy companies have abandoned deals following a widening gap in sto=ck prices that changed an acquisition premium. Western Resources Inc. of To=peka, Kansas last week sued Public Service Co. of New Mexico seeking hundre=ds of millions of dollars in damages after it failed to buy Western's utili=ties. The lawsuit accused Public Service of breaching its "duty of good fai=th and fair dealing" and said the New Mexico company tried to "sabotage" th=e deal as the two companies' stock prices diverged. Public Service denies t=he accusations.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

All Rights Reserved. =09The Corporation: AcquisitionsThe Other Instant Powerhouse in Energy TradingBy Louise Lee in San Mateo, Calif.11/26/2001BusinessWeek96(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)It's not easy being No. 4. Despite a $35 billion merger completed in Octobe=r, ChevronTexaco Corp. is still not one of the oil superpowers. Nor, at mor=e than $90 billion a year in revenues, is it a scrappy little guy. So Chair=man David J. O'Reilly has been searching for a strategy beyond just drillin=g for more oil and gas.=20Now, he may have something: a big stake in the No. 1 energy-trading company=. Chevron Corp. has owned 26% of Dynegy Inc. since 1996, and with Dynegy's =planned acquisition of Enron Corp., the top energy trader, ChevronTexaco is= making the oil industry's most aggressive push yet into this fast-growing =business. It plans to eventually pump $2.5 billion into the combined Dynegy= and Enron to maintain its 26% stake, and it might raise that share. So, wh=ile ChevronTexaco's much bigger rivals run small in-house trading operation=s, energy trading may soon account for more than 10% of ChevronTexaco's ear=nings. ``Chevron is now positioned to be a leader in the business,'' says a=nalyst Arjun Murti at Goldman, Sachs & Co.The deal would certainly dovetail with ChevronTexaco's strategy of becoming= a more integrated energy company, with a hand in everything from pumping o=il at the wellhead to trading natural-gas futures. By acquiring Texaco, Che=vron picked up, for instance, a big refining-and-marketing business --which= should balance out the bad times in oil and gas production, says Eugene No=wak, an analyst at ABN Amro. ``When crude-oil prices are down, they'll have= margin improvements on refining and marketing,'' he says. O'Reilly and oth=er ChevronTexaco executives declined to comment.=20Until now, Dynegy wasn't a big deal for Chevron. Chevron purchased the stak=e for $700 million when Dynegy was still called NGC Corp., and it filled th=ree of the 14 board seats--positions it will keep. Since then, Chevron has =sold nearly all its domestic natural-gas production to Dynegy. The stake ha=s been a good investment: it is now worth $3 billion, ChevronTexaco says.==20Sitting on $2.9 billion in cash as of the end of the second quarter, Chevro=nTexaco can well afford the Dynegy deal, analysts say.

CEO Charles L. Watson if he had sat= back and gloated. After all, Watson had watched as his bigger, brasher cro=sstown rival sniffed at Dynegy's more cautious strategy, all the while garn=ering most of the credit for reshaping the energy-trading business.=20Instead, Watson picked up the phone on Oct. 24 and called Enron Chairman, C=EO, and longtime acquaintance Kenneth L. Lay to ask how he could help. Lay =didn't respond immediately, but as Enron's stock continued to plunge and th=e company faced a cash squeeze, it became clear what the only realistic ans=wer could be: Bail us out.So two days later, Lay invited Watson to his River Oaks home near downtown =Houston for breakfast to discuss a deal. Over muffins and ``a bad cup of co=ffee'' the next day, Watson recalls, they sketched the outlines, and by 10 =p.m. that night, the investment bankers were called in. On Nov. 9, Dynegy a=nnounced that it would pay about $10 billion, plus the assumption of $13 bi=llion in debt, to buy Enron, which is nearly four times its size. The key t=o the deal was Dynegy's immediate $1.5 billion infusion of cash to shore up= Enron's balance sheet and save its credit rating. The money came from Dyne=gy's 26% owner, ChevronTexaco Corp.=20Without that help, Enron--the seventh-largest U.S. company, based on its $1=00 billion in sales last year--may well have faced bankruptcy. Watson says =that he never would have imagined such an outcome in his wildest dreams. ``=I don't think anybody foresaw the problems [at Enron],'' he says. ``It's be=en incredible to watch.''=20Watson, 51, has to make good on what may well be his riskiest investment ye=t. If he can pull it off, the new Dynegy will have revenues of more than $2=00 billion and $90 billion in assets, including more than 22,000 megawatts =of power-generating capacity and 25,000 miles of pipeline. It would control= an estimated 20% to 25% of the energy-trading market, up from about 6% now=.=20That would be sweet vindication for Watson's strategy. Dynegy backs trading= operations with hard assets such as power plants, which allows the company= to guarantee a supply of electricity to a buyer. In contrast, Enron has wo=rked furiously to shed power plants and oil- and gas-generating fields, bel=ieving it could earn higher returns using its trading and technology expert=ise to tap assets owned by others in markets including steel, pulp, and pap=er. IRRESISTIBLE BARGAIN. As Enron's stock slid below $9 from its August, 2=000, high of $90, it became a bargain that Watson couldn't pass up. It woul=d have taken years for Dynegy to build up a market-making operation to matc=h Enron's. Its risk-management systems are top-of-the-line. Enron's commerc=ial-services unit, which manages power supplies for corporate customers suc=h as Wendy's International Inc., is three or four years ahead of Dynegy's, =says Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy. Watson says he still plans to ge=t rid of the $8 billion worth of assets Lay had earmarked for sale, includi=ng the Portland (Ore.) General Electric plant and oil and gas assets in Ind=ia. For the $1.5 billion, though, if the deal falls through Dynegy will hav=e the right to Enron's prized Northern Natural Gas pipeline, worth an estim=ated $2.25 billion. And Dynegy can walk away if Enron's legal liabilities e=xceed $3.5 billion.=20Watson firmly believes that Enron suffered from a crisis of confidence, not= a meltdown of its core business. Indeed, Enron's wholesale-trading operati=on earned $2.3 billion last year. Says Watson: ``We know the business. We l=ooked under the hood, and guess what? It's just as strong as we thought it =was.''=20But the trading profits were obscured in recent weeks by Enron's accounting= tricks. The biggest danger for Watson is that there are other time bombs t=icking away. Already, the company has slashed its reported earnings since 1=997 by $591 million, or 20% of its total, to account for controversial part=nerships involving Enron officials. The Securities & Exchange Commission is= still investigating. ``We believe it will take more than just a couple of =weeks and a long-term relationship [between Watson and Lay] to do all the n=ecessary due diligence,'' says analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities= Inc. Dynegy's Bergstrom counters: ``We're pretty certain that most everyth=ing of material consideration has been disclosed.'' If not? The massive ear=nings boost provides ``a high margin of error,'' he says. A WANNABE. Of cou=rse, regulators may object to the concentration of trading operations. And =Watson will have to mesh two very different cultures. Enron is known for it=s intense, even cutthroat entrepreneurial spirit. Dynegy's operations are m=ore conservative; some compare it to a fraternity. Dynegy's decision to iss=ue new stock options to some Enron employees may soothe battered egos. It s=hould help, too, that Lay decided not to take the $60 million golden parach=ute he could have received in a buyout. As it is, Lay will not have a manag=ement job with the new company.=20Dynegy often seemed to be an Enron wannabe, following it into online tradin=g and commercial services. Still, Dynegy's 361% stock gains last year eclip=sed Enron's 87% rise, and it rankled some that Lay's execs got more credit.= ``Chuck Watson may not have been in the spotlight, but he has always been =at the forefront of this business,'' says Bruce M. Withers, who sold his Tr=ident NGL Inc. to Dynegy in 1995. Watson will get more attention next year-=-he's a 15% owner of the new Houston Texans pro football team.

Here's what companies should do-=-and what investors need to knowBy Nanette Byrnes and David Henry=20With Mike McNamee in Washington11/26/2001BusinessWeek76(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)In an age when giant earnings write-offs have become commonplace, it's hard= to shock Wall Street. But on Nov. 8, Enron Corp. managed to do it. After y=ears of high-octane growth that had seen earnings surge by up to 24% a year=, the Houston-based energy company acknowledged that results for the past t=hree years were actually overstated by more than a half-billion dollars. It= was confirmation of investors' worst fears. Three weeks earlier, Enron had= announced a big drop in shareholders' equity, sparking fears that its hide=ously complex financial statements were distorting its true performance. Ma=nagement pointed to a number of factors, including a dubious decision to ex=clude the results of three partnerships from its financial statements and a= billion-dollar error several years earlier that had inflated the company's= net worth.=20Enron may be an extreme example of a company whose performance fell far sho=rt of the glowing picture painted by management in its earnings releases, b=ut it is hardly alone. This year, Corporate America is expected to charge o=ff a record $125 billion, much of it for assets, investments, and inventory= that aren't worth as much as management thought (chart, page 79). Even if =companies don't go back and restate earnings, as Enron is doing, those char=ges cast doubt on the record-breaking earnings growth of the late '90s.Not since the 1930s has the quality of corporate earnings been such an issu=e--and so difficult for investors to determine. There's more at stake than =the fortunes of those who bought shares based on misleading numbers. If eve=n the most sophisticated financial minds can't figure out what a company ac=tually earns, that has implications far beyond Enron. U.S. financial market=s have a reputation for integrity that took decades to build. It has made t=he U.S. the gold standard for financial reporting and the preeminent place =to invest. It has also ensured ready access to capital for U.S. corporation=s. That a company such as Enron, a member of the Standard & Poor's 500-stoc=k index and one of the largest companies on the New York Stock Exchange, co=uld fall so far so fast shows how badly that gold standard has been tarnish=ed. ``The profession of auditing and accounting is, in fact, in crisis,'' s=ays Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now one of =the leaders of the International Accounting Standards Board.=20Sometimes, as in the case of Enron, fuzzy numbers result from questionable =decisions in figuring net earnings. More often, though, the earnings chaos =results from a disturbing trend among companies to calculate profits in the=ir own idiosyncratic ways--and an increasing willingness among investors an=d analysts to accept those nonstandard tallies, which appear under a variet=y of names, from ``pro forma'' to ``core.'' (Enron offers its own such vers=ion. Before investors untangled the importance of Enron's first announcemen=t, its stock rose briefly because it told investors that its ``recurring ne=t income'' had met expectations.) The resulting murk makes it difficult to =answer the most basic question in investing: What did my company earn?=20Why calculate a second set of earnings in the first place? Because the numb=ers reached by applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are= woefully inadequate when it comes to giving investors a good sense of a co=mpany's prospects. Many institutional investors, most Wall Street analysts,= and even many accountants say GAAP is irrelevant. ``I don't know anyone wh=o uses GAAP net income anymore for anything,'' says Lehman Brothers Inc. ac=counting expert Robert Willens. The problem is that GAAP includes a lot of =noncash charges and one-time expenses. While investors need to be aware of =those charges, they also need a number that pertains solely to the performa=nce of ongoing operations.=20That's what operating earnings are supposed to do. But because they're calc=ulated in an ad hoc manner, with each company free to use its own rules, co=mparisons between companies have become meaningless. ``No investor--certain=ly not any ordinary investor--can read these in a way that's useful,'' says= Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities & Exchange Commission. The SEC =is examining whether new rules are needed to clarify financial reports and =perhaps restrict use of pro formas.=20What's badly needed is a set of rules for calculating operating earnings an=d a requirement to make clear how they relate to net income. In the end, in=vestors need two numbers--a standardized operating number and an audited ne=t-income number--and a clear explanation of how to get from one to the othe=r. ``OUT OF HAND.'' A widespread consensus is building to do just that. In =early November, S&P proposed a set of rules for companies to follow when ta=llying operating earnings. Only the week before, the Financial Accounting S=tandards Board, the rulemakers for GAAP, had announced that they, too, woul=d be taking up this issue. Volcker says the International Accounting Standa=rds Board is also seeking a uniform definition of operating earnings.=20``Over the past two or three years, the use of creative earnings measures h=as grown and grown and grown to the point where it has really gotten out of= hand,'' says David M. Blitzer, S&P's chief investment strategist. ``Earnin=gs are one of the key measures that anybody looks at when they're trying to= evaluate a company. If people want to use an operating-earnings measure, w=e better all know what we're looking at.''=20Without those standards in place, the gap between earnings according to gen=erally accepted accounting principles and earnings according to Wall Street= is only going to grow wider and more confusing. Look at the variance in ea=rnings per share calculated for the S&P 500 for the third quarter: It's $10=.78 according to Wall Street analysts as tallied by Thomson Financial/First= Call, $9.17 according to S&P, and $6.37 according to numbers reported to t=he SEC under GAAP. (S&P, like BusinessWeek, is owned by The McGraw-Hill Com=panies.)=20The lack of a standard measure can be costly to those who choose wrong. Use= First Call's earnings for the past four quarters and you get a relatively =modest price-earnings ratio of 23 for the S&P 500. But run the numbers usin=g GAAP earnings, and suddenly the market has a far steeper p-e of 38.=20How did we get into this mess? Investors and analysts have been calculating= operating earnings for years, and for years, reasonable people could more =or less agree on how to do it. Then came the dot-com bubble, along with inc=reased pressure from Wall Street for companies to meet their quarterly earn=ings forecasts. Suddenly, companies that hadn't turned a profit by any conv=entional measure started offering ever more inventive earnings variants. Th=ese customized pro forma calculations excluded a grab bag of expenses and a=llowed upstart companies to show a profit. ``TOWER OF BABEL.'' Pro forma fo=rmulas vary wildly from company to company and even from quarter to quarter= within the same company, casting doubt on their validity. And these days, =the gulf between net earnings and pro forma earnings is wider than ever. S&=P's tallies fall between the two: S&P's numbers are more systematic than pr=o forma, but they aren't followed widely enough to be a standard. ``Investo=rs are facing a Tower of Babel,'' says Robert K. Elliott, former chief of t=he American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and a retired= KPMG partner. ``It's not standardized, and the numbers are not audited.''==20That makes it tough to evaluate a company's performance. In the quarter end=ed on Sept. 30, Nortel Networks Corp. offered shareholders at least three e=arnings numbers to choose from. By conservative GAAP accounting, the teleco=mmunications giant lost $1.08 a share. The company also provided two possib=le pro forma options: a 68 cents loss that excluded ``special charges,'' in=cluding some acquisition costs and restructuring charges, and a still bette=r 27 cents loss that further excluded $1.9 billion of ``incremental charges=,'' such as writing down inventories and increasing provisions for receivab=les. Wall Street chose the rosiest one.=20Confusing? You bet. Companies defend their pro forma calculations by pointi=ng out that they're merely filling a void: Investors are clamoring for a me=asure that gives them better insight into their company's future. The goal =is to get to the core of the business and try to measure the outlook for th=ose operations. ``There are good reasons why there is an emphasis on operat=ing earnings,'' says Volcker. ``It is an effort to provide some continuity =and some reflection of the underlying progress of the company.'' Besides, a=s companies like to point out, they still have to report GAAP earnings, and= investors are free to ignore everything else.=20There's no starker lesson in the shortcomings of GAAP than the $50 billion =asset write-downs by JDS Uniphase Corp., the biggest charge of the year. Ne=ar the height of the telecom bull market in July, 2000, the San Jose (Calif=.) maker of fiber optics topped off a buying spree by acquiring competitor =SDL Inc. for $41 billion in stock. When the deal closed in February, its as=sets ballooned from $25 billion to $65 billion. But by then, shares of JDS =and other fiber-optics makers were collapsing. To bring its acquisitions in=to line with their new value, the company took charges of $50 billion. Desp=ite the fact that the bulk of its losses stemmed from stock transactions an=d involved no cash paid, GAAP required that the charges be taken out of net= income. So according to GAAP, JDS lost $56 billion in the fiscal year endi=ng in June--a staggering figure for a company whose revenues over the past =five years added up to only $5 billion.=20Analysts and the company argue that besides not involving cash, the charge-=off was all about the past, a right-sizing of values that had gotten out of= hand. To analyze the company's prospects, they excluded the $50 billion ch=arge. ``The accounting is not designed to make things look better but to de=scribe what happened,'' says JDS Uniphase Chief Financial Officer Anthony R=. Muller, ``and we'll live with the consequences, whatever they are.'' Anal=ysts make a similar defense. ``My goal is to figure out what the business i=s going to produce so that we can value the company,'' says Lehman Brothers= analyst Arnab Chanda. GLACIAL PACE. Are JDS's pro forma numbers realistic-=-a fair gauge of JDS's ongoing operations? Right now, it's hard for investo=rs to judge. And that's the kind of ambiguity S&P and others would like to =eliminate. In November, S&P circulated a memo on how to standardize operati=ng earnings. Under the proposal, operating earnings would include the costs= of purchases, research and development, restructuring costs (including sev=erance), write-downs from ongoing operations, and the cost to the company o=f stock options. It would exclude merger-and-acquisition expenses, impairme=nt of goodwill, litigation settlements, and the gain or loss on the sale of= an asset.=20When S&P applied roughly that formula to JDS Uniphase, it split the differe=nce between Wall Street and GAAP. Because of differences in what each group= included in their earnings calculations, the results were chaotic. Using G=AAP, the company lost $9.39 a share. S&P figures it lost $3.19, while the c=ompany put the loss at 36 cents. Meanwhile, Wall Street says it made 2 cent=s.=20The S&P standard may make sense, but it raises the question: Where is the F=inancial Accounting Standards Board, the group in charge of GAAP? Chairman =Edmund L. Jenkins says FASB will be addressing the problems. Still, investo=rs shouldn't expect any improvement soon. The pace of change at FASB tends =to be glacial. It typically takes four years to complete a new standard. In= 1996, for example, the board realized that standards on restructuring char=ges had some big loopholes and it resolved to put the issue on its agenda. =In June, 2000, the board finally issued a draft of a new standard, asked fo=r comments, and held a public hearing. In October, 2001, the board said it =still wasn't ready to put a fix in place. Now, the recession has set off an=other wave of restructuring charges, and the FASB still doesn't have new ru=les.=20The slow pace means the standard-setters sometimes fail to react to sudden =changes in the market. The most recent failure followed the terrorist attac=ks on September 11. An FASB task force, unable to come up with a set of rul=es for separating September 11 costs from general expenses, instead told co=mpanies that the disaster could not be treated as an extraordinary item. So= GAAP earnings include costs stemming from the disaster as part of a compan=y's general performance. Many companies have nevertheless broken those cost=s out in their unaudited press releases.=20Many more are likely to do so in the fourth quarter. Indeed, 2001 is shapin=g up to be one for the record books. A poor economy and the devastating aft=ereffects of September 11 have resulted in a slew of unusual charges that a=re unlikely to recur and that no one could have foreseen. But there's a gro=wing concern that the earnings fog is providing managers with cover to hide= missteps of the past within that vast category of supposedly one-time char=ges. The temptation will be to take as big a charge as possible now, while =investors are braced for bad news. Not only can managers sweep away yesterd=ay's errors, but tomorrow's earnings will look even better.=20The basic question comes down to what constitutes a special expense--a char=ge so unusual that to include it in the earnings calculation would be to di=stort the truth about a company's performance. Usually, big charges fall in=to a few categories, including charges for laying off workers and restructu=ring a company, charges for assets that have lost value since they were pur=chased, charges for investments that have lost value, and charges for inven=tory that has become obsolete. In a recent study, Harvard Business School p=rofessor Mark T. Bradshaw found that companies are increasingly calling the=se charges unusual. That gives them a rationale for excluding them from the=ir pro forma calculations.=20Lots of critics disagree, saying such charges are often an inevitable part =of the business cycle and should be reflected in a company's earnings histo=ry. They certainly should not be ignored by investors. ``Charges are real s=hareholder wealth that's been lost,'' argues David W. Tice, manager of the =Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund with a pessimistic bent that's up 17% so f=ar this year. ``It's money they spent on something no longer worth what it =was, a correction of past earnings, or a reserve for costs moving forward. =Whatever the reason, it's a real cost to the company, and that hurts shareh=olders.'' Without standards, excessive write-offs from operating earnings c=an obscure actual performance. Without any rules, companies calculate opera=ting earnings inconsistently in order to put their companies in the best po=ssible light. Dell Computer Corp. is a good example of this ``heads I win, =tails you lose'' school of accounting. For years, Dell benefited from gains= in its venture-capital investments and was happy to include those gains in= its reported earnings, where they appeared as a separate line on the incom=e statement. But this year, when those gains turned to losses, the computer= maker issued pro forma numbers that excluded that $260 million drag. Dell =spokesman Michael Maher says the company's press releases and SEC filings b=reak out investment income and give GAAP numbers as well as pro forma. ``In= our view, the numbers are reported clearly,'' says Maher. ``It's all out t=here for the consuming public.'' PAST PUFFERY. Many experts believe special= charges are a sign that past performance was exaggerated. What should inve=stors make of a company such as Gateway Inc.? Two restructuring charges in =the first and third quarters, minus a small extraordinary gain, totaled $1.=12 billion, or about $100 million more than the company made in 1998, 1999,= and 2000 combined. Which is the truer picture of its performance and poten=tial? The write-offs or the earnings? Write-offs for customer financing are= another example. When Nortel increased its reserves for credit extended to= customers by $767 million in September, it effectively admitted it had boo=ked sales in the past to companies that couldn't pay--in effect overstating= its performance in those earlier periods. In addition, Nortel says booking= sales and accounting for credit are unrelated issues. Tech companies blame= the sharp downturn in their industry for the big write-offs. And these are=n't isolated examples. Peter L. Bernstein, publisher of newsletter Economic=s & Portfolio Strategy, found that from 1989 to 1993, 20% of earnings vanis=hed into write-offs.=20Big charge-offs can also distort future performance. Critics contend that e=xcess reserves are often used as a sort of ``cookie jar'' from which earnin=gs can be taken in future quarters to meet Wall Street's expectations. Or c=harges taken this year, for example, which is apt to be a lousy one for mos=t companies anyway, might include costs that would otherwise have been take=n in future periods. Prepaying those costs gives a big boost to later earni=ngs. Rules for figuring operating earnings would help, but this is an area =that will always involve a certain amount of judgment--and therefore invite= a certain amount of abuse. ``People are going to write off everything they= can in the next two quarters because they're having a bad year anyway,'' s=ays Robert G. Atkins, a Mercer Management consultant.=20Part of the lure of big special charges is that investors tend to shrug the=m off, believing that with the bad news out in the open, the company is poi=sed for a brighter future. Since Gateway detailed its third-quarter charge =of $571 million on Oct. 18, Wall Street has bid the stock up 48%, compared =with a 6% runup for the S&P 500.=20Often, though, investors should take exactly the opposite message. If, for =example, part of a restructuring involves slashing employee training, infor=mation-technology spending, or research and development, the cuts could dep=ress future performance, says Baruch Lev, a professor of accounting at the =Stern School of Business at New York University. ``Are these really one-tim=e events?'' he asks. ``Or is this the beginning of an avalanche?'' Indeed, =Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. strategist Steve Galbraith has found that =in the year following a big charge-off to earnings companies have underperf=ormed the stock market by 20 percentage points. ``LA LA LAND.'' Investors a=re apt to be faced with more huge write-offs next year, even if the economy= doesn't continue to worsen. Why? The transition to a new GAAP rule that ch=anges the way companies account for goodwill--a balance-sheet asset that re=flects the amount paid for an acquisition over the net value of the tangibl=e assets. Under the new rule, companies will have to assess their propertie=s periodically and decrease their worth on the balance sheet if their value= falls. An informal survey by Financial Executives International of its mem=ber controllers and financial officers found that at least a third expect t=o take more charges.=20But figuring out the proper value of those assets is no easy task. Unless t=here is a comparable company or factory with an established market price, v=aluing them involves a lot of guesswork for which there are no firm rules. =``What this is really coming down to is corporations and their auditors com=ing up with their own tests for impairment,'' says the Stern School's Profe=ssor Paul R. Brown. ``It's La La Land.''=20While the tidal wave of special charges is providing cover for earnings gam=es, it could also be an impetus for change--especially in the wake of the d=ot-com fiasco. Indeed, there are some signs of a backlash. The real estate =investment trust industry was a pioneer of engineered earnings, with its ``=funds from operations,'' or FFO. But now some REITs have begun to revert to= plain old GAAP earnings. Hamid R. Moghadam, CEO of San Francisco-based AMB= Property Corp., shifted back to GAAP in 1999. ``The reason I don't like FF=O is very simple,'' says Moghadam. ``One company's numbers look better than= another one's even if they had identical fundamental results.''=20There are other steps FASB could take to improve financial reporting and re=store GAAP's status. Trevor S. Harris, an accounting expert at Morgan Stanl=ey, says it could force companies to make clear distinctions between income= from operations and income from financial transactions. Lehman's Willens s=ays companies should provide more information on cash expenses and how they= bear on earnings. An easy step would be to require companies to file their= press releases with the SEC.=20At the least, says Lev, companies must clearly explain how their pro forma =numbers relate to the GAAP numbers. Otherwise, he says, investors ``see num=bers floating there, and where did they come from?'' In today's environment= of unregulated pro forma calculations and supersize write-offs, no questio=n is more important to investors.High-Gloss GlossaryCompanies are using a variety of accounting practices to put the best spin =ontheir results. Here's what those terms mean:DEFINING EARNINGS:NET INCOMEThe bottom line, according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAA=P).Sometimes called ``reported earnings,'' these are the numbers the Securitie=s &Exchange Commission accepts in its filings.OPERATING EARNINGSAn adjustment of net income that excludes certain costs deemed to be unrela=tedto the ongoing business. Although it sounds deceptively like a GAAP figurecalled ``operating income'' (revenue minus the costs of doing business), it= isnot an audited figure.CORE EARNINGSAnother term for operating earnings. Neither core nor operating earnings ar=ecalculated according to set rules. They can include or exclude anything thepreparer wishes.PRO FORMA EARNINGSThe 1990s term for operating earnings. Popularized by dot-coms, it sometime=sexcludes such basic costs as marketing and interest.EBITDAEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Thegranddaddy of pro forma, it was initially highlighted by industries thatcarried high debt loads, such as cable TV, but has since come to be widelyquoted.ADJUSTED EARNINGSA new term for pro forma.DEFINING COSTS:SPECIAL CHARGESA general term for anything a company wants to highlight as unusual andtherefore to be excluded from future earnings projections.ASSET IMPAIRMENTSCharges taken to bring something a company paid a high price for down to it=scurrent market value. Many companies are now taking these charges on intern=alventure-capital funds that bought Internet and other high-tech stocks atinflated prices.GOODWILL IMPAIRMENTSThe same idea as asset impairments except they're used to write down thepremium a company paid over the fair market value of the net tangible asset=sacquired. These charges will explode in the first quarter of 2002 because o=f achange in mergers-and-acquisitions accounting that eliminates goodwillamortization and requires holdings to be carried at no more than fair value=s.RESTRUCTURING RESERVESAn accrued expense (not usually cash) to cover future costs of closing down= aportion of a business, a plant, or of firings. These are projected costs an=dif overstated can later become a boost to earnings as they are reversed.WRITE-DOWNLowering the value of an asset, such as a plant or stock investment. It isoften excused as a bookkeeping exercise, but there may have been a real cos=tlong ago that now proves ill spent, or there may have been associated cashcosts, such as investment-banking fees.Illustration: Chart: THE BIG BATH CHART BY ERIC HOFFMANN/BW=20Illustration: Chart: EARNINGS CHAOS CHART BY ERIC HOFFMANN/BW=20Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09EditorialsEND THE NUMBERS GAME11/26/2001BusinessWeek130(Copyright 2001 McGraw-Hill, Inc.)What did the company earn? That's the most basic question an investor can e=ver ask. The equity culture that has generated so much growth over the year=s depends on a clear answer, but getting one has become impossible. Enron C=orp. just announced that its earnings for the past three years were oversta=ted by half a billion dollars. How did one of the biggest companies on the =New York Stock Exchange manage to inflate its earnings by 20% without audit=ors, analysts, ratings agencies, and the business press (BusinessWeek inclu=ded) discovering it? In part, blame the breakdown of standardized accountin=g rules and the anarchy that runs rampant in the financial statements of Co=rporate America. The U.S. needs a new set of accounting rules that gives a =clear picture of financial performance. Without integrity in financial repo=rting, the U.S. cannot hope to remain the preeminent place to invest in the= global marketplace (page 76).=20The dot-com bubble was the first indication that there was something seriou=sly wrong with accounting standards. Companies without much of a business m=odel customized their quarterly statements to exclude a grab bag of expense=s in order to put a positive financial spin on their operations. Wall Stree=t conspired in this and encouraged big companies to join in. Soon, the meth=od of calculating earnings began to vary from company to company and even f=rom quarter to quarter within a company. It is now chaos.A stricter adherence to accounting rules won't solve the entire problem. GA=AP, the generally accepted accounting principles, allow all kinds of one-ti=me expenses and noncash charges. This obscures the performance of ongoing o=perations. No one can fathom what are true operating earnings because there= are no guidelines as to what constitutes an extraordinary expense. The res=ult is total confusion. Take earnings per share for the Standard & Poor's 5=00-stock index for the second quarter. Under Thomson Financial/First Call s=tandards, it is $11.82. But it's $9.02 according to S&P and $4.83 under GAA=P. How can investors make intelligent decisions?=20The Financial Accounting Standards Board clearly is failing to do its job. =It has promised to write a set of rules that calculates operating earnings =and relates them to net earnings, but it hasn't delivered. The rating agenc=y Standard & Poor's (owned by The McGraw-Hill Companies, as is BusinessWeek=) is doing a better job. It recently drew up a definition of ``operating ea=rnings'' that includes restructuring costs (including severance), writedown=s from ongoing operations, and the cost of stock options. It excludes merge=r and acquisition expenses, litigation settlements, impairment of goodwill,= and gains or losses on asset sales. This is a beginning that FASB should b=uild on. The accounting anarchy has to end.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

But the stock market, after an initial selloff, has= shown remarkable resilience.=20Few observers expect stock-market volatility to subside soon. Still, expert=s say that now, more than ever, is the time for skittish investors to keep =their wits about them.In a recent interview, Charles R. Schwab, chairman and co-chief executive o=f Charles Schwab & Co., the San Francisco-based online and discount brokera=ge firm, gave his views on what investors should be doing -- and what mista=kes they should avoid.=20Here are some excerpts from the interview:=20In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, how much more risk, if any, do you thi=nk is in the financial markets? Or do you think it's just that people's per=ceptions about risk have changed?=20I've been investing since 1959, and I have to say that, year after year, th=e risk hasn't changed. The risk is always there. There's risk in investing =in stocks, bonds and even U.S. Treasuries because of interest-rate [fluctua=tions]. There's risk in real estate, too.=20So the question is: How do you handle it? The best way is to diversify. Ove=r a long period of time, people who diversify their investments do pretty d=arned well. When they don't . . . sometimes it's fatal. If the only stock a=n investor owned was Enron . . . or Cisco at 70, that was pretty fatal.=20What do you say to people who say they're too scared to invest right now? T=hat because of the threat of terrorism, the anthrax scares, the war in Afgh=anistan, the recession, and so forth, there's just too much uncertainty in =the markets?=20I remember back during the Cuban missile crisis, we all feared the worst. W=e were all building bomb shelters. It was a scary time. This terrorist thin=g is no different. It's awful -- particularly for our children. But this co=untry is so wealthy, in terms of its resources, intellectual capital and th=e strength of our government.=20There is no more uncertainty today than in times past. For example, we've h=ad many recessions. It's not fun, especially when you begin reading about a=ll these layoffs. In fact, I think the unemployment rate [now at 5.4%] pret=ty easily might get to 6.5% before it gets better. And it probably won't ge=t better until March or April. Also, the stock market will go up, hopefully= before the economy goes up.=20There's $2 trillion sitting in money-market accounts. That's a huge resourc=e and buying power that's definitely available for new investments.=20What do you think is the biggest mistake investors have made over the past =two or so months?=20They let their emotions take over. With the fear that people had, they didn='t use their rational thinking. They used their emotional thinking. [After =Sept. 11], they sold at the low, and fear was the driver.=20Just a year and a half ago, the driving emotion was greed. You're not going= to avoid this stuff. So the issue is how you manage through these cycles o=f fear and greed. Even when I'm fearful of something, I say to myself: "Thi=s is still the time to invest."=20My biggest worry right now is that people will give up and say, "I just don='t want to be in the stock market at all." And it's just the time that peop=le should be hanging on and keeping a diversified portfolio.=20Some other mistakes: A lot of people hang on to the stock that was the post=er child of the last cycle. Or people say, "I'll get back in [the market] w=hen I see the economy turn around." Well, by the time they see that, it's t=oo late. They will have missed the whole ride back up.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and ha=d very strong management." James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm.==20As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of man=agement of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclos=ure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over =a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its sh=are value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) =investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest repor=ts create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong?No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, =Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsew=here it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance a=nd general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures woul=d make an excellent case study!)=20But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, with=out much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 b=illion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, th=e charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launche=d an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly inv=olved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other =senior officials were sacked.=20Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, redu=cing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat simil=ar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded.=20It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas tr=ading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These compri=sed private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was= kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To= this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron= itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed th=reshold(s).=20All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and =mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations inclu=ding J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suf=fered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid thi=s and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creativ=e accounting genius.=20Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over t=he rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by th=e company's auditors one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million= as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year.=20The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the E=nron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit tha=t at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, b=alance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come o=ut, but what has come out is bad enough.=20But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billi=on) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warra=nt. But it turned out to be just that for Enron.=20Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lack=ed transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was= always somewhat fragile?=20But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity =analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between tradin=g and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aw=are of the opaqueness of the accounts,but few questioned the management agg=ressively on the subject. Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified =the spirit of the times trading assets was what the "masters of the univers=e" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The =Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal a=ctivity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming= that "we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopo=lies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world.=" (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's =inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst).=20For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that "=Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial tec=hnologies and physical technologies", bringing derivatives theory to tradin=g in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has= not led to more sober management of trading risks.=20Surely the role of "markets" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, be=tween producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse= in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forg=et this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer whether i=n the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, gre=ed obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a =little bit to the left?Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Fastow.=20Following Enron's announcement yesterday morning of the SEC inquiry, the co=mpany's stock took another big slide, falling more than 20% in New York Sto=ck Exchange trading. As of 4 p.m., Enron shares were trading at $20.65, off= $5.40, knocking about $4 billion off Enron's market capitalization. Volume= topped the Big Board's most-active list at about 36 million shares. A week= ago, Enron stock was trading at about $33 a share. Subsequently, the compa=ny announced a $1.01 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 m=illion loss.Analysts also voiced concerns yesterday about possible other bad news lurki=ng amid Enron's vast and extremely complex operations. The company has deal=ings with a number of related entities. Under certain circumstances, if Enr=on's credit rating and stock price fall far enough, the company would be ob=ligated to issue tens of millions of additional shares to these entities, d=iluting the holdings of current shareholders.=20Enron has previously acknowledged the provisions but said its business is s=trong and it feels confident that there will be no defaults.=20In a statement, Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the com=pany "will cooperate fully" with the SEC inquiry and "look(s) forward to th=e opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." Enron h=as consistently said that it believes its dealings with the Fastow-related =partnerships were proper and properly disclosed. The company has said it pu=t billions of dollars of assets and stock into partnership-related transact=ions as a way to hedge against fluctuating market conditions.=20The SEC inquiry came from the agency's Fort Worth, Texas, regional office. =According to a person familiar with the matter, this would indicate that th=e inquiry comes from the SEC's enforcement arm, as opposed to its corporate=-finance section. The participation of the enforcement branch would indicat=e that the agency is looking into whether there were possible violations of= securities law. However, enforcement-branch inquiries often don't produce =any allegations of wrongdoing. It also appears that the SEC hasn't yet take=n the step of launching a formal investigation, which would be a sign that =the agency believes securities laws might have been violated. The SEC decli=ned to comment.=20Certainly, there have been questions and concerns about those partnership t=ransactions, which contributed to a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder e=quity last week as part of Enron's efforts to unwind the deals. Mr. Fastow,= who has declined repeated interview requests, resigned from the partnershi=ps, known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, in late July in the f=ace of rising conflict-of-interest concerns by Wall Street analysts and maj=or company investors.=20Since then, internal partnership documents have shown that Mr. Fastow and p=erhaps a handful of Enron associates made millions of dollars last year in =fees and capital increases as general partner of the LJM2, the larger of th=e two partnerships.=20Mr. Fastow's partnership arrangement caused some unhappiness inside Enron, =according to people familiar with the matter. For instance, these people sa=y, sometime after the creation of the partnerships in 1999, Enron Treasurer= Jeffrey McMahon went to company president Jeffrey Skilling and complained =about potential conflicts of interest posed by Mr. Fastow's activities. Mr.= Skilling didn't share Mr. McMahon's concern, these people say, and Mr. McM=ahon requested and received reassignment to another post.=20Mr. Skilling resigned as Enron president and chief executive in mid-August,= citing personal reasons and the fall in Enron's stock price, which peaked =at about $90 a share last year. Mr. McMahon and Mr. Skilling haven't respon=ded to repeated interview requests.=20Investors are also concerned about potential problems arising in Enron's de=alings with other related entities. In some cases, Enron could be required =to issue large amounts of stock to noteholders in some of the entities if c=ertain so-called double trigger provisions occur.=20For example, last July Enron helped create the Marlin Water Trust II, which= sold $915 million in notes that are due July 15, 2003. However, Enron can =be considered in default, in advance of that date, if its stock price falls= below $34.13 for three trading days and its senior debt is downgraded to b=elow investment grade by either Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poo=r's.=20Currently, Enron debt is still investment-grade at both ratings agencies an=d would have to be lowered by several notches to fall into a noninvestment =grade category. Last week, Moody's put Enron on review for a possible downg=rade. However, observers believe that even if Moody's lowers Enron's rating=, the company will still be investment-grade.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. =09October 23, 2001Where Did the Value Go at Enron?By FLOYD NORRISNew York TimesWhat really went on in some of the most opaque transactions with insiders e=ver seen?Wall Street has been puzzling over that since Enron (news/quote </redirect/=marketwatch/redirect.ctx?MW=3Dhttp://custom.marketwatch.com/custom/nyt-com/=html-companyprofile.asp&symb=3DENE>) released its quarterly earnings a week= ago. Yesterday shares in Enron plunged $5.40, to $20.65, after the company= said that the Securities and Exchange Commission was looking into the tran=sactions.The reaction was in some ways puzzling. Given the questions that have been =raised since the earnings announcement - some of them prominently featured =in The Wall Street Journal - it was likely that the S.E.C. would begin a pr=eliminary inquiry.Whether it will go farther than that is not clear, but if nothing else the =slide in Enron shares over the last week shows the hazards that can confron=t a company that allows word of a major reduction in its balance sheet valu=e to dribble out. Enron's shares rose 67 cents, to $33.84, last Tuesday, as= investors first reacted to the earnings announcement. But since then they =have fallen $13.19, or 39 percent.The $1.2 billion reduction in shareholders' equity was not mentioned in a n=ews release Enron issued on its quarterly earnings last Tuesday. It was bri=efly mentioned in a conference call with analysts, but many of the listener=s seem to have not noticed that, wrongly thinking Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's c=hairman and chief executive, was referring to a $1 billion write-off that w=as disclosed in the earnings release.When questions were asked in the following days, the explanations were less= than thorough. Enron explained that the reduction in shareholders' equity =was related to the termination of "structured finance vehicles" involving p=artnerships that had been controlled by the company's chief financial offic=er."Both the debt and the equity people are looking for more clarity about how= the company goes about its business," said Ralph Pellecchia, a credit anal=yst at Fitch Investors Service. He added that the issue of the company's "c=redibility related to this transaction really seems to have a life of its o=wn."Enron declined yesterday to allow any officials to be interviewed about its= financial reports. But last night it said Mr. Lay would hold another confe=rence call with investors at 9:30 a.m. today.=20The company's earlier disclosures regarding the partnerships baffled many a=nalysts. They referred to such things as "share settled costless collar arr=angements" and "derivative instruments which eliminated the contingent natu=re of existing restricted forward contracts." The disclosures said the comp=any entered into the transactions "to hedge certain merchant investments an=d other assets."It appears that Enron was able to report profits from them, even though the= underlying assets included investments that declined in value. The Wall St=reet Journal, citing reports the partnerships made to institutional investo=rs, has reported the partnerships did well enough to make large cash distri=butions to their investors. Enron officials in recent days have refused to =discuss the arrangements in any detail.One of the questions that the S.E.C. may look into is whether the terminati=on of those transactions should have been treated as a balance sheet item, =or whether it should have been taken as a loss that affected reported earni=ngs. An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment.Under accounting rules, a company's transactions in its own shares cannot p=roduce profits or losses, whatever the effect on cash flow. So a company th=at sells its shares for $10 each, and buys them back at $50, or at $1, will= report no earnings effect. Enron said that the reduction to shareholders e=quity, and a related reduction in notes receivable, "is the result of Enron='s termination of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver En=ron shares in future periods."Stephen Moore, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who has put Enron'=s debt on review for a possible downgrade, said that while some of the deta=ils were not clear, "Essentially, Enron's promise was that a certain amount= of Enron's shares would be worth $1 billion. The shares plummeted, and the=y were not" worth that much.Enron emphasizes its own version of earnings, which leaves out some expense=s, and directs attention away from its balance sheet, which is disclosed on=ly in S.E.C. filings, not in the earnings news release. The reduction in sh=areholders' equity would be shown only on the third-quarter balance sheet, =which has yet to be released.Earlier this year, Jeffrey Skilling, then Enron's chief executive, reacted =strongly when a questioner on a conference call challenged the failure to p=rovide balance sheet numbers when earnings were released. He called the que=stioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners. Mr. Skilling late=r resigned for what he said were personal reasons and Mr. Lay, the chairman= and former chief executive, took back the latter title.While Enron was riding high, its often difficult-to-understand reports were= generally seen as not being a problem. The company appeared to be the domi=nant force in the business of energy trading, and to be able to produce phe=nomenal profits. When Mr. Lay was reported as having played an important ro=le in formulating the Bush administration's energy policies, the aura was o=nly enhanced. In January, the shares traded for $84.But now, with some of the company's ventures clearly having run into proble=ms, it appears that investors are growing less willing to accept the compan=y's reports. That the partnership transactions were disclosed at all was be=cause of the involvement of the chief financial officer, and some have wond=ered if there might have been similar deals with others.Mr. Lay has promised to make the company's financial reports easier to unde=rstand, and last week's report was at first praised by some analysts for do=ing just that.In a news release yesterday, Mr. Lay said the company welcomed the S.E.C.'s= request for information. "We will cooperate fully with the S.E.C. and look= forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to =rest," he said.FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION: SEC probes Enron over financial dealings=20Financial Times; Oct 23, 2001By JULIE EARLE, JOHN LABATE and SHEILA MCNULTYEnron, the US energy giant, disclosed yesterday that the Securities and Exc=hange Commission had asked it to provide financial information at the start= of an informal inquiry.=20The announcement follows a rapid sell-off in the stock in reaction to Enron='s surprise revelation last week of a Dollars 1.2bn charge to equity to eli=minate the dilutive effects of closing one of its controversial financing v=ehicles.=20In revealing the SEC call for more detailed information "regarding certain =related party transactions", Enron hopes to counter growing criticism that =it should be more transparent.

"We should have been informed that it was there."=20Mr Barone found it disturbing that Enron disclosed the charge in "a fleetin=g comment" during its conference call with analysts and did not mention it =in its nine-page news release.=20"Despite progress in other areas, there appears to be much more work ahead =before the lingering credibility issues that have vexed this company in the= past are fully resolved," he said.=20Enron contends that "we did disclose it in the conference call, and it was =one of the first points raised in the Q and A session (on the conference ca=ll)".=20Mr Lay has pledged to co-operate with the SEC's request, which appears to b=e part of an informal inquiry rather than an official investigation.

"We welcome this reques=t," said Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive of the Houston-based =company.But the announcement jarred investors' confidence in the giant energy-tradi=ng company, already hurt by the unexpected resignation of chief executive J=effrey K. Skilling in August, and heavy losses from investments in broadban=d Internet and other technology ventures."A lot of people threw in the towel today," said Anatol Feygin, an analyst =with J.P. Morgan in New York.The SEC request was made privately last Wednesday, the day after Enron repo=rted a $1 billion write-off of investment losses and restructuring charges =from unsuccessful technology ventures and other operations. The write-offs =left Enron with a $618 million loss in the third quarter (84 cents a share)=.The Wall Street Journal reported last week that $35 million of the write-of=f was tied to losses at limited partnerships established by Enron's chief f=inancial officer, Andrew Fastow, and run by him until July.Enron told investment analysts last week that it had repurchased 55 million= shares of its stock held by the partnerships that Fastow had directed, red=ucing shareholder equity by $1.2 billion.According to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow set up several investment part=nerships with the approval of Enron's board. The partnerships engaged in bi=llions of dollars in complex financial transactions involving Enron and mad=e major investments in power plants and other assets alongside Enron.An Enron shareholder has filed suit in Texas state court alleging that Enro=n's board violated its duty to the company by permitting the chief financia=l officer to engage in the outside transactions that allegedly earned milli=ons of dollars in fees for himself and other investors in the partnerships.= What Enron received from the relationships is not clear.Feygin said that the company had informed analysts about the limited partne=rships, which offered Enron a way to take positions in strategic but uncert=ain technology ventures without detailing the outcomes in its public financ=ial statements.=20"In hindsight, that was an error in judgment. I don't think it was an error= in principle," the analyst said.Enron could have revealed the SEC inquiry last week but did not disclose it= until yesterday, and for many investors, that was the last straw, Feygin s=aid.The stock closed yesterday at $20.65, down $5.40, as 36 million shares chan=ged hands.Staff researcher Richard Drezen contributed to this report.Enron Suffers After Unclear Disclosure, New York Times Says2001-10-23 06:31 (New York)     Houston, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Securities andExchange Commission's decision to look into some Enron Corp.transactions and the company's recent decline in value show whatcan happen when a company lets a major reduction in its balancesheet dribble out, Floyd Norris of the New York Times reported inhis column, citing analysts.

A copy of the complaint filed in this action is avai=lable from the Court, or can be viewed on Milberg Weiss' website at: http:/=/www.milberg.com/enron/=20The action, numbered H013630, is pending in the United States District Cour=t for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, located at 515 Rusk= Street, Houston TX 77002, against defendants Enron, Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey K=. Skilling and Andrew Fastow. The Honorable Melinda Harmon is the Judge pre=siding over the case.The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,= by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and= operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that= the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=ial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets= on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surp=rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring ch=arges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the= third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently,= Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind=ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled =by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin=g more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o=f the investments.

Denver, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Janus Capital Corp., whosestock funds have lost more than a third of their value this year,may get another jolt from Enron Corp.     As of June 30, Denver-based Janus was the biggestinstitutional holder of Enron, owning 42.8 million shares, or a5.71 percent stake in the largest U.S. energy trading company,according to Thomson Financial/Carson.     Enron shares have fallen 39 percent over the past four dayson concern that the company's dealings with partnerships run byits chief financial officer contributed to investment losses. TheSecurities and Exchange Commission has asked for information onthe partnerships, Enron said.     Janus, which boosted its Enron stake in the past year in aneffort to diversify its technology-heavy stock funds, is among ahandful of firms including Putnam Investments, Alliance CapitalManagement, Barclays Global Investors and Fidelity Investmentsthat owned more than 2 percent of the Houston-based company as ofJune 30, according to Bloomberg data.     ``It was definitely a real growth darling,'' said ChristineBenz, a senior analyst at Chicago-based fund tracker MorningstarInc. ``In a year like 2000, when almost nothing was working forgrowth managers, Enron emerged as a story that a lot of growthmanagers could like.''                           Fund Holdings     According to Thomson Financial, 1,187 mutual funds, or 15.4percent of all U.S. stock funds, owned a combined 207.9 millionEnron shares as of June 30. Combined losses on the holdings amountto $2.7 billion since Tuesday.     According to the latest available data compiled by Thomson,the biggest fund holders of Enron were: Janus Fund, with 2.15percent; Janus Twenty Fund, with 1.19 percent; Alliance PremierGrowth Fund, with 1.14 percent; American Century Ultra Fund, with1.01 percent; Janus Mercury Fund, with 0.88 percent; Vanguard 500Index Fund, with 0.82 percent; Fidelity Magellan Fund, with 0.73percent; AIM Value Fund, with 0.6 percent; CREF Stock Account,with 0.58 percent; and, Putnam Investors Fund, with 0.52 percent.     Janus Fund has lost 33.2 percent this year through Friday,while Janus Twenty Fund has lost 33.4 percent and Janus MercuryFund has fallen 34 percent. A Janus spokeswoman wasn't immediatelyavailable to comment.     Morningstar's Benz said she suspects Janus fund managers havealready begun trimming their Enron positions.     Enron shares had fallen 59 percent this year before lastweek's news on concerns about financial reporting and money-losinginvestments outside energy trading, such as trading space onbroadband telecommunications networks and building water treatmentplants.     The stock fell $5.40, or 21 percent, to $20.65 in New Yorktrading today.     ``Anecdotal evidence that I'm hearing from the fund managersthere is that they had been trimming pretty aggressively,'' saidBenz. She added that it's ``difficult to make the assertion thatthey are in the clear.''     Janus Capital is owned by Kansas City, Missouri-basedStilwell Financial Inc., whose shares gained 73 cents today to$22.52. Stilwell shares have fallen 43 percent this year.Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)2001-10-22 18:30 (New York)Enron Says SEC Asks About Related-Party Transactions (Update9)     (Adds information on conference call in 26th paragraph.)     Houston, Oct. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s shares fell 21percent after the Houston-based company said the Securities andExchange Commission requested information on partnerships run byChief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives.     Enron, the largest energy trader, created partnerships andother affiliated companies to buy and sell assets such as powerplants to lower the debt on its books. An investor sued Enron'sboard Wednesday, saying two partnerships cost the company $35million and Fastow's leadership of them was a conflict ofinterest.     Investors today said they were concerned that Enron may beforced to dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off theowners in cash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week hemay be have to ``unravel'' agreements that created the companiesif Enron's debt ratings fall too far.     ``We need confidence their long-term credit rating won't gobelow investment grade,'' said Roger Hamilton, an analyst at JohnHancock's value funds, which own 600,000 Enron shares.     Enron reduced shareholders' equity by $1.2 billion when itrepurchased 55 million shares of two such partnerships controlledby Fastow, LJM Cayman and LMJ2 Co-Investment, the Wall Journalreported last week.     Dismantling more of the affiliated companies and partnershipswould cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, RayNiles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report toinvestors today.                           Shares Plunge     Enron shares fell $5.40 to $20.65. They touched $19.67 duringthe day's trading, the lowest level since Jan. 15, 1998.     The stock has fallen 75 percent this year amid concerns aboutfailed investments in trading of space on fiber-opticcommunications networks and a water company, and the resignationof Jeff Skilling as CEO in August after seven months on the job.     While Skilling said he resigned for personal reasons,investors say his departure led them to question whether thecompany was concealing problems, including possible liabilitiesfrom affiliated companies.     On Tuesday, Enron surprised many investors when it reported a$618 million third-quarter loss, the result of writing off $1.01billion in failed investments.     Moody's Investors Service placed the company's debt on watchfor possible downgrade. The company's debt is rated at investmentgrade by Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's.     The company received a faxed request for information from theSEC on Wednesday asking for information, spokesman Mark Palmersaid, and will respond ``as soon as possible.''     ``We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward tothe opportunity to put any concern about these transactions torest,'' Lay, who is also Enron's chairman, said in a statement.                          Dilution Fears     Enron has formed at least 18 companies to serve as financingvehicles for its projects, based on filings with the Texassecretary of state. Fastow and other Enron executives are named asthe controlling partners or the board members in the companies.     Some have bought Enron assets such as power plants, removingthe debt for those projects from Enron's books. That allows Enronto keep cash earned from the main trading business from supportingwhat it views as secondary businesses, Standard & Poor's debtanalyst Todd Shipman said.     Enron brokers trades of electricity, natural gas and othercommodities as well as owns power plants and natural-gaspipelines.     Dismantling the affiliates would be costly. WhitewingManagement, an affiliated company that has bought 14 Enron powerplants and lists Fastow as managing director, holds 250,000preferred shares of Enron.     Enron may have to convert the preferred shares to commonstock if share prices fall below a certain level and the creditrating drops below investment grade, according to company filings.That would dilute the value of common shareholders' investment.     ``The concern is how many of these dilutive structures areout there?'' Shipman said. ``Investors are worried they might haveto share their Enron earnings with a lot more people than theyoriginally thought.''                        Worrisome Financing     Enron's auditors and attorneys reviewed the company's``related party arrangements,'' the board approved them, and theywere disclosed in SEC filings, Enron said in its statement.     That hasn't eased concerns. The reduction of shareholderequity by $1.2 billion from the LJM partnerships is reason toworry about Enron's other financing vehicles, wrote Niles, theSalomon analyst. Enron also may take another $2.4 billion inlosses from investments in the Dabhol power plant in India andprojects in South America, he wrote.                            Bonds Fall     Enron's 8 percent coupon bonds due in 2005 fell $34 per$1,000 face value to be offered at $1,022 today from $1,056 onFriday, traders said. Yield on the debt rose to 7.33 percent from6.33 percent.     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels aboveinvestment grade.     Fastow continues to work, and Enron hasn't punished him,Palmer said. Fastow declined to be interviewed, spokeswoman KarenDenne said. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on theagency's request to Enron.     ``We believe everything that needed to be considered and donein connection with these transactions was considered and done,''Lay said in the statement.     Enron will hold a conference call to discuss investors'concerns at 9:30 a.m. New York time Tuesday.

But other big deals that have yet to receive much public =scrutiny could further damage the company's balance sheet.=20In the spotlight last week were transactions done with investment partnersh=ips called LJM2 and LJM Cayman. An examination of the LJM2-related equity w=ritedown can be found here.=20However, the LJM deals make up only part of Enron's sophisticated financing= arrangements. Also at issue are two large trusts that contain assets Enron= shifted from its balance sheet. These are the $1 billion Marlin Water Trus=t II and the $2.4 billion Osprey Trust, usually known as Whitewing.=20The key risk for investors is how Enron chooses to repay these trusts if th=ey don't unwind as planned. The company may end up issuing stock to repay m=oney borrowed through the trusts. This would dilute existing shareholders. =Alternatively, Enron could resort to using cash raised through sales of on-=balance sheet assets. But this would hamper efforts to reduce debt and depr=ive the company's profitable business lines of much-needed capital.=20Whitewing and a Prayer?Though set up by Enron, Marlin II and Whitewing are legally distinct from t=he company. Institutional investors bought notes issued by the trusts. The =$3.4 billion in proceeds from the notes flowed to Enron.=20Both trusts are scheduled to unwind in 2003. Originally, Enron had hoped to= repay them by selling the trusts' underlying assets. This repayment method= would have had a minimal impact on Enron's balance sheet.=20However, there's a potential problem brewing with this approach. The value =of the assets may be too low to raise sufficient funds to pay back the trus=t investors. Hence Enron's two unenviable options: issuing stock, or raisin=g cash from its own balance sheet.=20Enron treasurer Ben Glisan concedes that assets in Marlin II won't be suffi=cient to pay it back. But he adds that proceeds from planned sales of on-ba=lance sheet assets will provide Enron with the necessary funds for Marlin I=I. When asked if Whitewing's assets are adequate for repayment, Glisan repl=ied: "We believe so."=20In reference to the two trusts, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay said on a conference =call Tuesday: "We anticipate the sale of assets will be the primary source =of repayments."=20Sterling MarlinTheStreet.com hasn't seen offering documentation for Whitewing; Enron didn'=t provide it when requested. But TSC has reviewed the Marlin II prospectus.= Here's how Marlin II works. Enron took water assets, primarily based in th=e U.K., off its balance sheet, and the Marlin II trust took a stake in them=. Meanwhile, Marlin II issued senior debt to investors, the proceeds of whi=ch went to Enron. The company didn't have to recognize these notes as debt =on its balance sheet, due to the structure of the trust. Marlin II replaced= a similar trust called Marlin that was set to mature at the end of this ye=ar.=20Ideally, the aim was for Enron managers to maximize the value and profitabi=lity of the assets over the life of Marlin and Marlin II so it could sell t=hem off and pay down the trusts. To cover the risk that asset sales wouldn'=t raise enough money, Enron also pledged to issue as much new convertible p=referred stock as might be needed to pay off the notes.=20As it happened, the water assets didn't perform well. In fact, Enron set up= Marlin II in July to succeed the original Marlin because it wanted to avoi=d paying off the first Marlin with convertible stock, or with cash from its= own balance sheet. This move risked angering the rating agencies that had =agreed not to treat Marlin as debt because of Enron's pledge to backstop it= with preferred stock. Suddenly, it seemed Enron was wriggling out of its c=ommitment to make good with stock.=20Enron's Glisan responds that many of the investors in the first Marlin also= invested in Marlin II, illustrating that investors weren't upset by the ma=neuver.=20Glisan says Enron almost certainly won't decide to issue stock to pay off M=arlin II. Instead, he adds, money from pending asset sales can be used to p=ay it off when it matures in July 2003. When asked if Enron might use the e=xpected $1.9 billion in proceeds from selling Portland General, the utility= based in Portland, Ore., Glisan replied: "That's a good one."=20But using the Portland General windfall would run counter to Enron's freque=ntly stated strategy of selling off low-yielding assets and investing the p=roceeds in higher-yielding businesses. Portland General is almost certainly= a more profitable business than the U.K.'s Wessex Water, which is the domi=nant asset in Marlin II. In addition, doing so would mean Enron couldn't us=e all the Portland proceeds to pay off debt. Enron aims to get its debt-to-=total-capital ratio down to 40%, from the current 50%.=20MaturityWhat about Whitewing, which matures in early 2003? Glisan lists Whitewing's= assets as: Central American gas distribution assets; turbines destined for= European power stations; interests in European power stations; and various= debt and equity participations in energy investments. Glisan says these as=sets can be sold to pay off the $2.4 billion in notes issued by the trust.==20But what would happen if the Whitewing assets can't fetch the necessary pri=ce? Enron could sell off more on-balance-sheet assets. But, again, this wou=ldn't help debt-reduction efforts, and it may be running short of large ass=ets that it can quickly sell.=20Whitewing is backed with Enron convertible stock. But Enron may be reluctan=t to issue paper when its stock is so far below recent highs, and current s=hareholders may begrudge the prospect of further dilution.=20Investors also need to keep their eyes on the early-repayment triggers of t=he trusts. In fact, the stock price-related element of the triggers has alr=eady been set off. For Whitewing, the stock has to fall below $59.78; for M=arlin II, the stock has to be under $34.13. However, something else has to =happen before the trust investors can claim their money back through asset =sales and stock issuance. Enron's credit rating must fall below investment =grade. That looks to be a long shot, since its rating is currently three no=tches above subinvestment grade. But it is something the market will watch =after Moody's said last week that it was putting Enron on review for a poss=ible downgrade.=20Despite all the questions stemming from the trusts, Enron still seems keen =to use the structure. Last week, Barclays Capital was inviting investors to= subscribe to an Enron-related entity called the Besson Trust. This is bein=g set up to enable Enron "to monetize substantially all of its interests in= EOTT Energy Partners," an Enron affiliate that markets and transports crud=e oil. Expected proceeds from the deal are $227 million, according to the p=rospectus. Could Enron be setting up new trusts to pay off damaged old trus=ts?=20Due to off-balance sheet financings like Marlin II and Whitewing, it's clea=r that uncertainty could weigh on Enron's battered stock for some time.=20Why Enron's Writedown Unnerves Some InvestorsBy Peter Eavis <mailto:peavis@thestreet.com>Senior ColumnistTheStreet.com10/22/2001 07:15 AM EDTURL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/detox/10002713.html>Enron is trying to improve disclosure to investors, but its decision to red=uce equity by $1.2 billion in the third quarter has created dismay and conf=usion in the market.=20The action was disclosed in a dubiously discreet manner. More important, in=vestors are struggling to pinpoint how the shrinkage will affect Enron's ba=lance sheet, profits and earnings guidance.=20Enron didn't provide answers to questions submitted on the equity reduction=.=20Enron doesn't include a balance sheet in its earnings release, so the equit=y decrease couldn't be spotted in numbers supplied Tuesday. And even though= Enron did break out $1 billion in earnings charges in its release, the com=pany didn't feel it necessary to mention the equity write down anywhere in =the text.=20Instead, the public first heard about it on a Tuesday conference call. CEO =Kenneth Lay said Enron had shrunk its equity as a result of terminating a s=o-called "structured finance arrangement." The Wall Street Journal later re=ported that Enron's counter-party in this transaction was an investment par=tnership called LJM2 Co-Investment, which has set up and run by Enron's fin=ance chief, Andrew Fastow.=20This is what Lay said on the Tuesday call about the equity move: "In connec=tion with the early termination, shareholders' equity will be reduced appro=ximately $1.2 billion, with a corresponding significant reduction in the nu=mber of diluted shares outstanding." According to The Journal, Lay then sai=d Wednesday on another call that Enron had repurchased 55 million shares.==20Enron's supporters count Lay's mention of a reduction in the share count as= bullish, because it should boost earnings per share numbers in the future.==20But there are two possible problems with this theory.=20First, Enron affirmed its previous earnings guidance that it expects to mak=e $2.15 per share in operating earnings next year. Critically, the company =did not say whether its guidance was given using a share count without the =55 million shares or not. If the forecast does assume the exclusion of the =55 million shares, the company should have upped its 2002 per-share earning=s forecast by around 6%, since that's the amount by which the share count w=ill be reduced. Enron needs to say what share count it's using in its guida=nce.=20Second, it's almost impossible to determine where these shares were ever re=corded, casting a certain amount of doubt on Lay's assertion that the share= count will come down.=20Why question the CEO? Well, in its 2000 annual report, Enron included some =disclosure of the 55 million shares connected with LJM2. It reads: "At Dece=mber 31, 2000, Enron had derivative instruments...on 54.8 million shares of= Enron common stock." The derivative instruments appear to be types of opti=ons, or agreements that give the counterparty the right to buy or sell stoc=k at agreed prices.=20But these derivatives-linked shares don't show up where they should in the =annual report: in the table that breaks out the difference between the basi=c and diluted share counts. The line item in this table that shows options-=related shares totals only 43 million shares, which is close to the amount =of employee pay options that qualified for inclusion. Therefore, that numbe=r almost certainly doesn't include the 55 million LJM2-related shares. The =fact is, at least some of the 55 million derivatives-linked shares should b=e included if the derivatives were like normal options. That's because the =LJM2 derivatives appear to have been "in the money", or profitable for the =holders. Typically, all in-the-money options-based stock has to be included= in the diluted share count. And these LJM2 derivatives did appear to have =that status at the end of 2000. Back then, Enron stock was trading around $=80, way above the average $68 level at which these derivatives made money f=or LJM2.=20Maybe these weren't simple options and had other conditions attached that e=xcluded them from the diluted share count. That's what disclosure elsewhere= in the annual report appears to imply.

New York, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the biggestenergy trader, has asked Citigroup Inc. to arrange a $750 millionloan, ensuring access to credit if the embattled company is cutoff from money markets, say people familiar with the matter.     Enron's shares and bonds plunged yesterday after the companysaid the Securities and Exchange Commission was probing itsfinances. The Houston-based business, whose stock has fallen 75percent this year amid concerns about failed investments, dependson a $3 billion commercial paper, or short-term debt, program tofinance day-to-day operations.     Earlier this month, Moody's Investors Service placed all $13billion of the company's long-term debt securities on watch forpossible downgrade. As a second-tier commercial paper borrower,any drop in its rating may cut off Enron from the commercial papermarket and raise the costs of short-term debt.     ``We understand that our credit rating is critical to boththe capital markets and our counterparties,'' Enron's ChiefFinancial Officer Andrew Fastow said on a conference call today.He said Enron has $3.5 billion available on bank credit lines,giving it enough cash to operate normally.     Enron shares rose as much as 12.6 percent during the call to$23.25. They pared the gain to $21.80, up $1.15.     Dan Noonan, a spokesman for Citigroup's Citibank NA unit,declined to comment. Mark Palmer, a spokesman for Enron, declinedto comment.                      Commercial Paper Rates     Enron was paying 3.15 percent to issue commercial paper untilOct. 31, which is as much as 15 basis points more than companieswith the same ``A2/P2'' short-term credit ratings that are not oncredit watch. Enron's short-term debt is not on review for apossible downgrade.     Enron has previously turned to Citigroup for finance andadvice. In 1999, Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit advised thecompany on its $1.45 billion acquisition of three natural gas-fired power plants from Cogen Technologies Inc. Citibank, alongwith J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., this year arranged a $1.75 billionloan.     Earlier this week, an investor sued Enron, saying twopartnerships cost the company $35 million and Fastow's leadershipof them was a conflict of interest.     The SEC has asked Enron about partnerships and affiliatedcompanies headed by Fastow. Dismantling some of the partnershipswould cost Enron or its shareholders as much as $3 billion, RayNiles, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, wrote in a report toinvestors.     Enron created partnerships and affiliated companies to buyand sell assets such as power plants to lower the debt on itsbooks.     Investors said they were concerned that Enron may be forcedto dismantle the affiliated companies by paying off the owners incash or stock. Chief Executive Ken Lay said last week he may haveto ``unravel'' agreements that created the companies if Enron'sdebt ratings fall too far.--Mark Lake in the New York newsroom (212) 893-5989 orEnron Corp. Cut to `Reduce' at Edward Jones2001-10-23 11:42 (New York)     Princeton, New Jersey, Oct. 23 (Bloomberg Data) -- Enron Corp. (ENE US)was downgraded to ``reduce'' from ``accumulate'' by analyst Zach Wagner atEdward Jones.--Michael O. Donohue in Princeton, New Jersey, (+1)609-279-3756.Enron CFO: Company Has Sufficient LiquidityBy Christina CheddarOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/23/2001Dow Jones News Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said the company had procedures in place to avoid conflicts of interest in dealings between Enron and partnerships that were set up and run by its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the Houston energy trading company to provide additional information about the partnerships, which Enron said were off-balance sheet financing vehicles used to hedge against fluctuations in the market.In a conference call held Monday to discuss investor concerns about the SEC investigation and related matters, Lay said there was a "Chinese wall" in place to protect the interest of Enron shareholders. The procedures were "rigorously followed," Lay said. In previous filings with the SEC, Enron said the terms of the transactions with the partnerships were "reasonable compared to those which could have been negotiated with unrelated third parties." Fastow resigned from the partnerships, which were known as LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investments LP in late July. The company also is involved in other off-balance sheet financing vehicles, including Marlin Water Trust II and Whitewing. During the conference call, investors said they were frustrated by the complex nature of the trusts, and asked for more information. Lay said the company would be providing a list of "Frequently Asked Questions" on its Web site later Tuesday that may provide more details. After Enron disclosed the SEC investigation Monday, the company's stock sunk to its lowest level in 52 weeks, $19.67. Enron shares were recently trading up 47 cents, or 2.3%, at $21.12, in brisk volume that has already surpassed its average daily turnover of 6.3 million shares. Lay said he was "extremely disappointed" in the current stock price. "Our businesses are performing very well and we are continuing to conduct business," he said. During the conference call, Enron officials declined to specify Fastow's role in the partnership, citing the ongoing SEC investigation and a derivative lawsuit filed against Enron that alleges its board breached its fiduciary duties by allowing Fastow to create and run the partnerships. Enron officials also addressed concerns that investors had about the potential need to issue additional Enron stock. Under certain circumstances, for example, if both Enron's stock and credit rating fall to certain levels, the company would need to issue additional shares to the partnerships, diluting the holdings of current shareholders. Enron officials declined to say how much dilution would occur under a "worst-case scenario." However, the officials said they doubted there would be a need to issue the additional stock because the company plans to work with the credit-rating agencies to prevent such an event. Moody's put Enron on watch for a downgrade of its long-term debt last week after the company announced a $1 billion third-quarter write-off that produced a $618 million loss. According to Lay, Enron's debt rating would need to fall several notches to below investment grade in order to trigger the need to issue more stock. "We are committed to maintaining our ratings," Lay said. "Moody's said they would work with us," he added. Furthermore, Fastow said, Enron expects to have "sufficient liquidity" to meet all its capital requirements. Enron's efforts to unwind the LJM partnerships contributed to a reduction of $1.2 billion in shareholder equity. However, Enron's Lay said the lower number of shares outstanding wouldn't affect the company's earnings outlook. Enron has said it expects to earn $1.80 a share in 2001 and $2.15 a share in 2002. The numbers are in line with the consensus estimates reported by Thomson Financial/First Call. "Despite the economy going softer, we think we can meet that," Lay said. -By Christina Cheddar, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-5166; christina.cheddar@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron says shareholders' 'best interests' were sought in all LJM dealings10/23/2001AFX News(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News LtdNEW YORK (AFX) - Enron Corp said it sought the "best interests" of its shareholders in all its dealings with LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment LP, two partnerships which were set-up and run until recently by Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. "The board (of Enron) was fully aware and kept a real Chinese wall between Enron and LJM. Enron's shareholders best interests were sought in all LJM dealings," said Enron chief executive officer Kenneth Lay, in a conference call with analysts.The company scheduled the call after Enron's stock slid 21 pct yesterday, when it revealed the Securities and Exchange Commission asked the company to provide information on certain related-party transactions. Overnight, two class action lawsuits were launched by shareholders against Enron and its officers, alleging that operating results were also "materially overstated" as a result of the company failing to timely write-down the value. In its third-quarter results last week, Enron announced a charge of 1.01 bln usd, of 1.11 usd per share, and an incremental 1.2 bln usd reduction in stockholders' equity, related to the unwinding of investments with the LJM partnerships. According to the Wall Street Journal, Fastow resigned from the partnerships in July, due to growing suspicion over potential conflicts of interests. During the call, Lay said that he, and Enron's board of directors, have "the highest faith and confidence in (Fastow)." Lay also said the company remained confident that its current liquidity position allows it to meet all its obligations, and is confident of the outlook for its corporate rating. Analysts have raised the possibility that, should Enron's credit rating and stock price continue to fall, the company may be obligated to issue millions of new shares to meet obligations with other entities it deals with. ng/cml For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

US class action suit filed against Enron for misleading statements10/23/2001AFX News(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News LtdNEW YORK (AFX) - Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach LLP law firm said it filed a class action lawsuit yesterday against Enron Corp alleging that it issued misleading statements between Jan 18, 2000 and Oct 17, 2001, thereby inflating the company's share price artificially. The suit was filed on behalf of Enron shareholders between the above period and is pending in the US District Court in Houston against Enron Corp, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay, former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned recently, and Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow. The suit claims that Enron issued statements which failed to disclose that the company was experiencing a declining demand for bandwidth and that its efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth failed because many market participants were not creditworthy.The company's operating results were also "materially overstated as result of the company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with certain limited partnerships" managed by the company's CFO. The suit additionally alleges that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On Oct 16, Enron announced unexpectedly that it was taking third quarter non-recurring charges of 1.01 bln after-tax, or 1.11 usd per share, which it later revealed was due largely to the unwinding of investments with certain limited partnerships controlled by Enron's chief financial officer. Enron also announced it was cutting shareholder equity by 1.2 bln usd. Enron's share price consequently fell sharply. During the class period, Enron insiders disposed of 73 mln usd of personally-held Enron common stock. Holders of Enron stock between the class period in question may request appointment as a lead plaintiff no later than Dec 21, Milberg Weiss said. Yesterday, Enron announced that the Securities and Exchange Commission has requested that it provide information regarding certain related party transactions. jkm/shw For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Financial Post: NewsWord of SEC probe puts Enron into deep dive: Problems mountDavid Howard SinkmanReuters10/23/2001National PostNationalFP2(c) National Post 2001. All Rights Reserved.NEW YORK - Shares of Enron Corp. slumped more than 20% yesterday after it said U.S. regulators are looking into company transactions, another blow to a company whose chief executive resigned in August. A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss an inquiry by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating.The SEC also declined to outline details of its inquiry. Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by reports from The Wall Street Journal about its relationship with two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The company also reported last week its first quarterly loss in more than four years, and took US$1.01-billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. Problems at Enron surfaced two months ago when CEO Jeff Skilling resigned after six months at the helm. Enron shares declined US$5.49, or 21%, to US$20.56 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, shaving off almost US$4.2-billion of its market capitalization. The stock, the biggest decliner by percentage loss on the NYSE, fell as much as 22.8% yesterday, when it opened at its lowest level since September 1998. Enron declined to comment on whether the SEC's inquiry into "certain related-party transactions" involved the partnerships. "Related-party transactions" is the heading used by Enron in its 1999 and 2000 annual reports to discuss dealings with its limited partnerships, LJM Cayman LP and the larger LJM2 Co-Investment LP, which engaged in complex hedging transactions involving company assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with the partnerships in June. LJM was set up in June 1999 for energy-related investments, and LJM2 in December 1999 for energy- and communication-related investments. The Journal reported US$35-million of its third-quarter loss of US$638-million were connected with the limited partnerships Curt Launer, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said investors should question Enron's use of real value accounting when the value of certain assets, "most notably in telecommunications," have declined precipitously. "Investors have had several opportunities to question Enron's credibility and at each of those turns the share price has declined," Launer said. Some analysts, though, cautioned against assuming fire when there might only be smoke. "This is an inquiry, not an investigation, and I cannot imagine Enron's attorneys or accountants would allow it do to something illegal," said Merrill Lynch analyst Donato Eassey. "It's easy for the market to kick a company when its down, but these challenges do not last for a solid company, and we think Enron is one." The price of shares in the company is down 75% this year.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. City - SEC inquiry sparks Enron share fall.By Simon English.10/23/2001The Daily TelegraphP31(c) Telegraph Group Limited, London, 2001in New York ENRON, the American power giant, saw its shares slump by a fifth yesterday after it revealed that the top financial watchdog is delving into firms managed by chief financial officer Andrew Fastow.The Securities and Exchange Commission is requesting details of deals between the company and limited partnerships with which Mr Fastow has, or had, links. Enron chairman Kenneth Lay said in a statement: "We welcome this request. We will co-operate fully and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest." Questions were raised last week on Wall Street after the company announced a write-down of more than $1 billion due to failed investments in telecoms and other businesses. The disclosure alarmed investors and sent the already battered shares down 23pc. Yesterday they fell another $5.30 ( #3.80) to $20.75 in early trading. According to the annual report the "related party transactions", as Enron describes them, took place in 1999 and 2000, resulting in losses of $16m and $36m respectively. Mr Lay said that auditors approved the deals, but would not give further details of what they were. They are understood to have been hedging transactions against Enron shares and other assets made by partnerships called LJM Cayman LP and LJM2 Co-Investment JP. "We believe everything that needed to be considered and done in connection with these transactions was considered and done," added Mr Lay. The relationship between the investment losses and the SEC probe is not clear, though the inquiry seems to focus on the partnerships responsible for the hedging transactions. Enron owns Teesside Power Station and Wessex Water in Britain and is the largest trader of natural gas in the US. Investors are concerned that the probe and the continued uncertainty about the extent of the problem will harm the company's credit rating. An Enron spokesman said Mr Fastow continues to work and is not under any suspicion. The SEC inquiry is "informal", says the company. The watchdog contacted Enron last Wednesday, the day of the results announcement. The SEC declined to comment. Enron made a loss of $638m in the third quarter, its first in over four years.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Business; Financial DeskShares of Enron Plummet 21% Energy: SEC requests information from company on series of unusual financial deals tied to executive.NANCY RIVERA BROOKSTIMES STAFF WRITER10/23/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionC-1Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyShares of Enron Corp. set a 52-week low Monday on word that the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information about a complex series of financial transactions between the Houston-based energy giant and an investment partnership tied to a company executive. Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said it had voluntarily provided information on "certain related-party transactions" that had been previously disclosed to the SEC."We welcome this request," said Kenneth L. Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive. "We will cooperate fully with the SEC and look forward to the opportunity to put any concern about these transactions to rest," he said. The SEC request is the latest in a parade of bad news for Enron, which has seen investments sour in telecommunications, retail electricity sales and water. Investors have battered the company's stock, which once sold for nearly $85 a share in the last year, and many have criticized Enron's stingy meting out of financial information. But several Wall Street analysts remain upbeat on the stock, noting that the bulk of its businesses continue to thrive despite the growing economic downturn. In August, Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling, one of the main architects of the company's strategy of shedding physical assets in search of trading profit, stunned Wall Street by resigning. Skilling cited personal, family-related reasons, but later he acknowledged that the precipitous plunge in the company's stock price contributed to his departure. On Monday, Enron shares plunged $5.40, or nearly 21%, to close at $20.65 on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron's stock has lost nearly 40% of its value in the last week since it reported a surprise third-quarter loss of $618 million after $1.01 billion in charges reflecting the costs of recent failed investments. But the charge also included $35 million related to what Enron described only as the "early termination during the third quarter of certain structured finance arrangements with a previously disclosed entity." In a conference call with securities analysts about the earnings, the company mentioned that it had repurchased 55 million shares as part of the dissolution of its participation in the transactions. But investors were stunned when stories last week in the Wall Street Journal detailed that the transactions were with a limited partnership organized by Andrew S. Fastow, Enron's chief financial officer, and that Enron had whittled $1.2 billion off its shareholder equity as it repurchased the shares and canceled a $1.2-billion note it had received from the partnership. Shareholder equity now stands at $9.5 billion. The limited partnership, called LJM2, and Fastow reaped millions of dollars of profit through complex hedging transactions that involved Enron assets and stock, the Journal reported. Lay said the transactions were reviewed by auditors and lawyers inside and outside the company and that the company board was fully informed. A shareholder lawsuit charging that Enron's directors violated their fiduciary duty already has been filed in Texas state court. Many companies set up limited partnerships for tax purposes, but it is unusual to allow company executives to run them, analyst say. Investors also are upset by the unusually zealous way that Enron has guarded financial information, making it difficult to analyze the company's complex web of businesses. And many are not confident that all the bad news has been released. Analyst M. Carol Coale, who follows Enron and other energy companies for Prudential Securities in Houston, downgraded Enron to a "hold" from a "buy" rating Monday out of such frustration. Coale said she has been getting misinformation or no information out of Enron. But Bob Christensen, energy analyst with First Albany Corp., said that despite Enron's recent difficulties, the bulk of the business remains strong. "I continue to tell investors that 70% of this company's business is growing at a 26% rate, and that was in the third quarter when this country had a very sharp economic slowdown going on," he said. Investors are panicking because of a "bad news story that doesn't reflect reality," said Jon Kyle Cartwright, senior energy analyst with the Raymond James & Associates brokerage firm in St. Petersburg, Fla. "They are the world's largest energy trader, and they are very good at that," Cartwright said. "The reality is that everything is fine here," although more charges, perhaps $500 million worth, are expected in the next few quarters, related to businesses that Enron is selling.GRAPHIC: Losing Its Spark / Los Angeles Times; Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares declineda ninth day as Moody's Investors Service lowered its creditrating, raising concern the largest energy trader would be cut offfrom raising the cash it needs to fund day-to-day operations.     Moody's lowered Enron's senior unsecured long-term debtratings to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1'' and alsoplaced the Houston-based company's ``P-2'' rating for commercialpaper on review for downgrade.     Moody's may downgrade Enron's commercial paper rating, whichwould make it harder for the firm to borrow the short-term cashneeded to run its trading businesses. Ahead of a potential cut,Enron took out bank lines to repay $2 billion in commercial paperlast week, largely removing itself from that borrowing arena.     ``They've pretty much already written off coming to thecommercial-paper market,'' said Shannon Bass, who holds Enronbonds in the $50 million he helps manage at Pacific InvestmentManagement Co. ``The real issue now is trying to get their housein order.''     Pimco is ``well underweight'' Enron bonds relative to bondbenchmarks the portfolios are matched to, Bass said.                             Shut Out     Companies such as Xerox Corp., which was shut out of thecommercial-paper market a year ago before its credit ratings werereduced, were forced to borrow on bank credit lines to accesscash. Investors in commercial paper, borrowings due in nine monthsor less, also stopped buying Motorola Inc. and Lucent TechnologiesInc. short-term debt, forcing the firms to restructure borrowing,sell assets, and find alternative financing sources that typicallycost more.     Enron shares plunged $1.59, or 10 percent, to $13.81,continuing a slide that dates back to Oct. 17, when Enron reported$1.01 billion in losses from investments outside its business ofenergy trading.     The stock traded near $90 in September 2000 and touched aseven-year low of $13.55 today. Enron has lost more than $50billion in market value this year. On Dec. 31, the company had amarket capitalization of $62.7 billion. Today, the market valuewas $10.5 billion.                           Deterioration     While Enron shares have sank about 60 percent in a week, itsbonds are down about 20 percent. A company's stock typically fallsfaster than its debt because bondholders have first claim onassets after bank loans are paid.     The company's 6.4 percent bonds maturing in 2006 fell 4 centsto 80 cents on the $1 of face value after the Moody's downgrade.Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 before thatdowngrade, traders said. The bonds were trading at 100 cents theweek before.     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration inEnron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.The partnership investments had not been disclosed before thismonth, which ``led to a substantial loss in investor confidence,''according to Moody's.     ``A credit downgrade will be punitive as far as theirborrowing power,'' said Joe Correnti, who follows Enron for WayneHummer Investments LLC in Chicago. ``That's not a good place forthem to be. They have somewhat aggressive expansion plans.''     Enron's recent woes had many investors factoring in a credit-rating reduction. ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen,who holds Enron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets hehelps manage at Mony Life Insurance Co.     There are about $15.8 billion of Enron bonds outstanding,almost $9 billion of which comes due between 2003 and 2006,according to Bloomberg data.                            Cash Needed     Last week, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastowafter the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked forinformation about transactions he conducted for partnerships heheaded. In August, Jeff Skilling quit as Enron chief executive,eight months after taking the position, and Chairman Ken Lay movedback into the position.    Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans fromCitigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calminvestors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stockhas plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when Fastow's partnershipswere disclosed.    Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow moneyfor the cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades andto keep trading partners.     ``When you act as a middleman you need high credit ratings.It's likely their trading volumes will go down'' as other energyand financial firms seek higher-rated trading partners, said SeanEgan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co., which givesEnron's credit a junk grade of ``BB+.''     Enron's long-term ratings outlook was changed last week tonegative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed the firm'srating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent of Moody's ``Baa1''.     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect ourgrowth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.``We are still investment grade.''Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)2001-10-29 16:08 (New York)Enron's Lenders to Demand Harsher Terms, Analysts Say (Update2)     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., which can't getlow-interest, short-term loans, faces skeptical lenders who willdemand increasingly harsher terms as the largest energy tradertries to get cash in the bank, credit analysts said.     ``Anyone providing new funding is going to be nervous,'' saidSean Egan, managing director at Egan-Jones Ratings Co. ``It'slikely that lenders are going to demand collateral.''     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans fromCitigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calminvestors after a 52 percent drop in the company's stock sinceOct. 17, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company needs cashevery day to settle commodities transactions and to keep tradingpartners.     The company on Thursday tapped $3.3 billion in bank creditlines last week to pay off about $2 billion in commercial paper,or short-term corporate loans. A week ago, the Enron said the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission had began an inquiry intorelated-party transactions. They cost the company $35 million and$1.2 billion in lost shareholder equity.     ``Banks are in the driver's seat, and Enron is a littledesperate,'' said Peter Petas, a debt analyst at CreditSights Inc.``I think their interest rates for loans would go up.''                       Sells Assets for Cash     Companies in Enron's situation often agree to other bankterms in order to secure loans, Petas said. Those can includeagreeing to use proceeds from selling assets to pay debt andputting up assets as collateral.     Enron is attempting to sell assets to raise cash. Two relatedpartnerships, Osprey and Marlin, depend on selling power plantsand similar assets to repay $3.3 billion borrowed to buy theplants. Enron may have to pay any difference between the debt andsales proceeds.     The company plans to complete the $2.9 billion sale ofPortland General Electric, an Oregon utility, to Northwest NaturalGas Co. next year.     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell $1.59, or 10 percent, to$13.81. The stock has tumbled 82 percent in the past 12 months.Enron May Be Royal Dutch/Shell Takeover Target, Newsletter Says2001-10-29 13:31 (New York)     Houston, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- The Royal Dutch/Shell Group,the second-largest publicly traded oil company, may be interestedin buying Enron Corp., which has seen its stock price plunge inthe last two weeks, industry newsletter Power Finance & Riskreported, citing unnamed sources.     With Enron's market valued dropping below $11.5 billion froma high of more than $55 billion, companies such as RoyalDutch/Shell would be able to buy it with ``little trouble,'' thenewsletter reported.     Royal Dutch/Shell, based in London and The Hague,Netherlands, had approached Enron about a buyout in August, andhas sought to purchase the company for three years, the newslettersaid, citing an unnamed banker in London and an unnamed analyst inNew York.     Shell spokesman Mary Brennan said the company wouldn'tcomment on market speculation. Enron didn't immediately returncalls seeking comment on reports of possible buyout offer.Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)2001-10-29 12:29 (New York)Enron Credit Cut by Moody's; CP Rating Put on Review (Update3)     (Adds yield data in fourth paragraph; adds Moody's commentsin sixth and seventh paragraphs.)     New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit ratingwas cut by Moody's Investors Service after the largest energytrader wrote down the value of its assets because of losses fromprivate partnerships.     Moody's also said it may downgrade Enron's commercial paperrating, which could make it harder for the company to borrow theshort-term cash it needs to run its trading business in thefuture. The company borrowed from banks to repay $2 billion incommercial paper last week.     ``This move was anticipated,'' said Mike Dineen, who holdsEnron bonds in the $5 billion of fixed-income assets he helpsmanage at Mony Life Insurance Co.     Enron's 6.4 percent coupon notes due in 2006 fell as much as4 cents to bid at 80 cents on $1 of face value after the Moody'sdowngrade, traders said. The bonds tumbled from about par value aweek ago. Yields have risen to 12.1 percent, up from 10.8 beforethat downgrade, traders said. Shares of Enron fell as much as$1.85, or 12 percent, to $13.55.     Moody's lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratingsof Enron to ``Baa2,'' two levels above junk, from ``Baa1.'' Theratings company said they may be lowered further. Moody's placedthe company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial paper on review fordowngrade.     Moody's said the cut was prompted by the ``deterioration inEnron's financial flexibility'' since the write-downs and charges.The partnership investments had not been disclosed before.     Enron's recent disclosures have ``led to a substantial lossin investor confidence,'' Moody's said in its news release.                            Cash Needed     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses this month frominvestments outside its business of trading commodities such aselectricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastowquit as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked forinformation about transactions he conducted for partnerships heheaded.     Enron is trying to get $1 billion to $2 billion in loans fromCitigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and other banks to calminvestors, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company's stockhas plummeted 57 percent since Oct. 17, when the partnerships weredisclosed.     Enron uses its investment-grade credit rating to borrow moneyfor the  cash it needs every day to settle commodities trades andto keep trading partners.     ``Enron definitely depends on higher ratings,'' Dineen said.     Enron's long-term credit ratings outlook was changed lastweek to negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmedthe Houston-based company's rating of ``BBB+'', the equivalent ofMoody's ``Baa1''.     ``We have been split-rated before and it did not affect ourgrowth,'' said Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Enron.`` We are still investment grade.''Insiders at Electric Utilities Showing Their Faith=20By Jonathan Moreland <<mailto:jonathan@insiderinsights.com>>Special to TheStreet.com10/29/2001 03:30 PM ESTURL: <<http://www.thestreet.com/comment/moreland/10003164.html>>Name an industry where one of its best-known players went public in 1996, s=aw its stock rise more than 1,800% in the following five years, but now fin=ds its shares half off their 2001 highs? Internet? Telecom equipment?=20Surprise! The stock is Calpine (CPN:NYSE - news - commentary) , and the ind=ustry is electric utilities.=20Three other stocks in the same group have given investors pretty wild rides= as well, only to find themselves well off their 52-week highs: AES (AES:NY=SE - news - commentary) , Mirant (MIR:NYSE - news - commentary) and NRG Ene=rgy (NRG:NYSE - news - commentary) .=20These four companies also have something else in common: Insiders at all of= them are signaling that their stocks are oversold. When there is significa=nt insider buying in so many related firms, we cannot help but think there =is a positive industry trend to profit from.=20Utilities may not seem like a sexy sector, but these particular stocks have= proved that they can move as well as any small-cap, high-tech play. Their =volatility stems from the fact that the companies they represent are not re=gulated utilities paying fat dividends, but independent power producers (IP=Ps) that derive as much profit as they can from the margins over fuel costs=.=20In some ways, IPPs are to regulated utilities what the old English navy was= to the Spanish Armada. IPPs are less restricted in the scope and geography= of their business movements. This has spurred a more entrepreneurial cultu=re at IPPs that often allows them to outmaneuver regulated utilities when c=hasing after business opportunities.=20The insider buying at all four companies was obviously interesting. They al=l had several insiders recently purchasing within a short time period, and =many of the buyers also had good track records trading their companies' sha=res. Several were also adding significantly to their holdings.=20At AES, for example, three of the eight executives that purchased shares in= late September for $13 a share or less, were also smart sellers over the p=ast few years when AES fetched between $40 to $60. And at Mirant, the five =insiders that purchased in September increased their holdings by an average= of 53%.=20This confluence of positive insider signals was more than enough to get me =researching these companies and this industry further, and I like what I se=e.=20"There's been a lot of talk about if we have an oversupply of energy," rema=rks Calpine spokesperson Katherine Potter on one of the main reasons IPP st=ocks are weak now. "But while supply may be fine right now, you also have t=o look at the quality of [that] supply. There is such a tremendous opportun=ity to replace infrastructure."=20Out With the Old, In With the NewThe fact is, there are a lot of antiquated power plants and overburdened ba=ckbones in the power industry, and IPPs stand to benefit tremendously from =replacing the older infrastructure to service the growing demand for energy= in the U.S. and abroad.=20With more scheduled and unscheduled maintenance of the present, aging facil=ities exacerbating price spikes, municipalities and industry would much rat=her choose reasonably priced energy from dependable sources if they are ava=ilable.=20Although most IPPs use oil, gas, coal or a combination of these fuels to po=wer present facilities, the vast majority of plants they're building now ar=e a new generation of natural gas-powered turbines that are much more effic=ient than old gas-fired facilities. An IPP will typically build one of thes=e new plants near cities or other areas with high and growing electricity n=eeds, and compete with the older facilities in the region for the business.==20But it's not really fair competition. New plants can generate up to 40% mor=e energy from the same amount of gas used by some older designs. The new na=tural gas turbines also have a smaller footprint and fewer emissions than t=heir predecessors, and can therefore be located closer to where the power i=s needed. Can you say lower transmission costs?=20So with the cost of the natural gas representing a good two-thirds of a gen=erator's cost, less fuel expenditure combined with a decrease in transmissi=on infrastructure to pay for leaves more love left for an IPP's bottom line=.=20As older gas-fired and nuclear plants are decommissioned, IPPs will continu=e to increase the amount of product (and profits) they produce. At the same= time, the trend toward more efficient gas plants will help slow the increa=ses in overall demand for natural gas, and keep the cost of this commodity =from reaching stratospheric levels.=20Although, as previously mentioned, IPP stocks are well off their highs, ana=lysts are as taken with the group as insiders are right now. Most analysts =following the four IPPs I've recommended rate them a buy or strong buy.=20This is not too surprising considering that bottom-line growth for NRG, AES=, and Calpine next year is forecast at 24% to 25%, while analysts expect Mi=rant to boost earnings per share by 30% in 2002. All of these shares are tr=ading for 12 times or less the low end of next year's EPS expectations.=20Chartists will note that the technicals of the IPP stocks I've mentioned st=ill look weak, and may choose to wait for a better entry point. But longer-=term investors should feel comfortable joining the insiders now.=20PostscriptReaders will note that we have not included Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commen=tary) in our group of recommended IPPs. Although we cannot boast of foresee=ing its present travails (resulting from too-clever-by-half off-balance she=et investments), we had ignored it because Enron did not have a positive in=sider signal like its peers.=20Insiders were still selling Enron as late as Aug. 2 of this year when the s=tock was nearly half off its highs, and although there was one insider purc=hase in August, there was not a cluster of activity as in the other IPP sto=cks we've recommended. There was no buying after Sept. 11.=20If Enron's problems are unique to it, as the industry insiders we talked to= believe, this is yet another case of insiders giving investors an excellen=t signal of relative attractiveness of stocks within an industry.=20A Debacle Like Enron's Can Undermine the Entire MarketBy James J.

The stock was again the mo=st active mover on the New York Stock Exchange as close to 28 million share=s had changed hands.Moody's said it cut the senior unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1, =and the ratings remain on review for potential additional downgrades. The a=ction follows Enron's reported $1.01 billion charge in the third quarter an=d was driven by the expectation of further write-downs and the swift deteri=oration of the company's financial picture, said Stephen Moore, vice presid=ent at Moody's.=20"However, we do feel the move Enron made to draw down their revolvers to pa=y off their commercial paper was a smart business move," said Stephen Moore=, vice president at Moody's. The rating agency said it would review the Pri=me-2 rating on Enron's commercial paper.Last Thursday, Enron announced it had tapped its lines of credit to provide= more than $1 billion in cash liquidity and that would it use $2 billion to= pay down commercial paper.The decision to pay off the commercial paper, he said, accomplishes two goa=ls."It increases liquidity on a short-term basis, and additionally, it enables= them to focus on other areas they need to focus on right now," Moore said.= "They are working on setting up an additional facility for further capital= to support their wholesale trading business."=20Karen Denne, an Enron spokesperson, confirmed Monday that the company is in= discussions with banks for further financing.

We wi=ll be meeting soon with them to resolve issues such as these."Moore said the meeting could come as soon as this week."Should the wholesale trading business and the counterparties therein becom=e impacted by these events, that could lead to the slowing growth of the wh=olesale business, the Enron engine," he said.=20Moody's action Monday also negatively affected the ratings on two trusts --= Marlin Water Trust and Osprey, which have combined debt of $3.2 billion.

A week later, it disclosed that the U.S. Se=curities and Exchange Commission had asked for information on partnerships =run by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow and other executives. Fastow w=as forced to step down from the company last week.=20The turmoil makes it clearer than ever that Enron's problems weren't solved= by the recent departure of Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling.In these challenging times, Enron deserves our thanks=20Houston Chronicle, October 28, 2001By BILL WHITE=20Enron and its employees have blessed Houston, and many Houstonians should n=ow take the time to say "thanks" when the company has experienced some high=ly publicized challenges. Enron attracted thousands of great people to Hous=ton and changed Houston's economy forever. The company's management encoura=ged their employees to be active citizens, and those folks responded by mak=ing a big difference in their community.=20Enron's lead in shaping a nationwide market for electricity gave birth to a= multibillion-dollar new industry, with Houston as its hub. Even while it c=ompeted hard to win in the marketplace, Enron's example helped show other n=atural gas pipeline and trading firms how to move into the even bigger mark=et of electricity. The downtown concentration of these firms -- industry le=aders including Reliant, Dynegy, El Paso and Duke Energy -- led London's Fi=nancial Times to refer to Louisiana Street as the Wall Street of electricit=y.=20This explosive growth attracted bright young people -- with the average age= of Enron employees at under 35 -- and they in turn helped fuel an explosio=n in residential growth in Houston's downtown. This, in turn, helped revita=lize downtown's retail and restaurant scene. Enron's construction of a larg=e Class A office tower, still going up, is a milestone in Houston's growth,= an official end to more than a decade of large amounts of vacant office sp=ace.=20Virtually every civic or charitable activity in Houston learned to count on= Enron for both financial support and thousands of hours of invaluable volu=nteer activities. If Enron or its chairman, Ken Lay, led a visionary effort=, such as hosting the meeting of G7 trade ministers, or more recently the p=rivate funding of the Houston Biotechnology Center, Houstonians knew it wou=ld be done right. Without Lay our town would have lost major league basebal=l and status as a big league town.=20Employees know Enron set a standard for hiring and promoting employees base=d on their potential, with no glass ceilings. Women have run large division=s and subsidiaries. Many military officers find that Enron called on their =talents after illustrious military careers, even at ages well past normal c=orporate entry level. The most highly recruited young people flock to a com=pany that invests heavily in their training and then lets them rise as far =and fast as their talent and ability to work hard would allow them.=20Enron's corporate success reflects the stories of so many of its employees =who have lived the American dream. With the habits of work learned on a fam=ily farm in Missouri, Ken Lay got an education ending with a graduate degre=e at the University of Houston, served his country in government and began =a career in the gas pipeline business. When Northern Natural Gas acquired t=he smaller Houston Natural Gas, Northern's chairman surprised folks by inst=alling Lay as his successor. I was at Northern's headquarters in Omaha the =week after the merger 16 years ago when Northern's chairman reassured folks= that they could count on "best young executive in the business, Ken Lay," =to direct their future in a changing marketplace. Within 15 years, most of =Enron's revenues and profits came from businesses that did not even exist w=hen Lay had taken over, all of which had been created from within the firm.= This success did not diminish the farm boy decency and sense of fairness t=hat attracted top talent to his team.=20Enron rewarded innovation, while many firms afraid to alter the old formula= wondered why their leadership eroded. Year after year, top executives thro=ughout the country voted Enron our nation's most innovative corporation. En=ron recognized, even when financial markets do not, that innovative firms a=re secure enough to accept occasional failure and the inevitable price of o=ther successes.=20Rather than seeking insulation from the international marketplace, as had m=any American businesses, Enron welcomed the challenge of the international =market, confident that American firms could compete and win. Enron also wel=comed the challenge of responsible environmental stewardship, and called on= industry to address the issue of global warming even as some companies fea=red the impact of pollution control on their bottom line.=20Enron's phenomenal success created incredible and perhaps unreasonable expe=ctations, as early this year when the stock market valued the company based= on 20 percent annual growth, forever. Enron's size and success made it a c=onvenient target for politicians in California and India, even as Enron sup=plied the electricity they so needed. Sometimes it seemed the company's ups=tart origins as the David battling utility Goliaths delayed the firm's perc=eption that it had won and no longer played the role of an underdog.=20And so if Enron experiences problems, it will learn from them, just as stro=ng people do. Let's not prejudge Enron's current challenges. The more than =a decade of my life that was dedicated to trying cases against companies wh=o hurt consumers and investors taught me both to insist on the truth but ne=ver to jump to premature conclusions based on a headline or a news story.==20Throughout its years of success, Enron folks have never forgotten to find s=o many ways to make the firm's hometown of Houston a better place to live a=nd work. As Enron enters a new phase of its life, let's not forget to expre=ss thanks and steady support.=20White is a Houston business executive and civic leader and former governmen=t official, with no relationship to Enron.

meeting with : Jeff,As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater involvement in the EBS relationship.   In the past, EBS had included David on the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq (Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with our relationship.Kim GodfreyDirector, Enterprise ServicesEnron Broadband Servicesphone : 713 345 8813cell :      713 501 8105fax:        713 853 7354Jeff.Gooden@compaq.com12/18/00 07:58 PM  To: Kim Godfrey/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc:  Subject: RE: Compaq / EBS Relationship Kim,Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, DaveSpurlin "Owns" the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq's perspective.All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your lifeeasier.Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; Myreaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enronand Compaq.

meeting on : David and Bob,We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS relationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities (storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.  After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as the point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe or Kent Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and issues.  EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop the streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our relationship.  The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until those changes are made:1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice amount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 on or before December 31,2000.   2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.  Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

meeting with : Thanks, Chaz, for the response.  What I am looking for in question #3 (purchase commitment) is did I convey the info correctly re:  what BMC will accept from Enron to allow the EBS deal to close?  From notes to the Net Works directors and Bob McAuliffe, I have copied the following statements into the space below:  "1)  The pricing is applicable if EBS gets their deal done, and you are willing to provide some form of commitment (at least in writing, either e-mail or letterhead) to purchasing a BMC product in 2001...  For example, if Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their current testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail (or other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001 (the preference would be to get the "buy" done by end of 1st Qtr, if possible).  This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with their purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC."  Is this correct the way I have presented it to NetWorks?  Will their replies work for you if completed as requested above? I didn't want to put you in a bind when I told the NetWorks teams what BMC would feel is acceptable proof-of-commitment, nor did I want to have to go back to the Net Works group and change the requirements.I've got another note to send you in a minute or so, from Doug Cummins.Thank you,JeffChaz Vaughan@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS12/12/2000 07:29 PM To: Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON cc: Stephen Morse/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Subject: Re: BMC UpdateJeff,Thank you for your efforts on the BMC deal.  We are making real progress.  Here are the answers to your questions:1.  How much do they want you to guarantee them in BMC revenue?  $4 MM in software and $2.4 MM in maintenance and professional services2.  Are you still looking at a $13MM TCV over 5 years?  No, our current TCV over 5 years is $10 MM 3.  Have I properly conveyed the "accepable-to-BMC method" of proving purchase commitment from Enron?  Not sure what you mean here4.  Your note re:  getting the Prof'nl Svcs contract signed says it has to be done by 6pm the 14th...what if you don't get it until the morning of the 15th?We prefer the 14th, but if we can't get it until the 15th, that will workPlease let me know if you have any other questions.  I will call you tomorrow to touch base.Thanks,Chaz VaughanEnron Broadband Services1400 Smith StreetHouston, TX  77002Ph:  713-345-8815Cell: 713-444-3074Fax: 713-853-7354Chaz_Vaughan@enron.net Jeff Youngflesh@ENRON12/12/00 04:43 PM  To: Stephen Morse/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Chaz Vaughan/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Jennifer Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron, Brad Nebergall/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Eric Merten/Enron Communications@Enron Communications Subject: BMC UpdateSteve/Chaz - I have taken your EBS Professional Services contract through our contracts folks, and we have ended up with it now being in EBS' contracts dept w/one of your attorneys.

meeting on : All,In our meeting on the 17th of November, the NetWorks team explained their position(s) relative to possible upcoming purchases of software, in which BMC might be selected as the vendor.  There were several issues and concerns which were voiced, mostly related to BMC's lack of support and suboptimal application capability (that is the "net", understated version).Bob, you and I spoke briefly after the meeting regarding what, if anything, BMC could do to "fix their problem".  I relayed the gist of our brief conversation to EBS.As discussed in the meeting, EBS has a near-term opportunity to get a deal done with BMC, and it would be of optimum benefit to execute this year.  One of the outcomes of our November 17 meeting is that EBS has been pressing BMC for a BMC commitment to Enron's overall customer satisfaction.  Per a voicemail to me from EBS, it appears that BMC have provided a response to EBS.I would like to schedule a meeting for the addressees of this note for either November 30th, or December 1st.  The purpose is to get an update from the NetWorks team on the BMC application testing that was underway, and for EBS to explain what BMC has proposed.  This meeting should take an hour.  Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow or Friday.  I'll book a room and time that works for the majority, and confirm with a Notes "Meeting Invitation".Thank you,Jeff Jeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716

to meet : Jennifer,I spoke w/Jenny Rub about almost every BMC/EBS issue, except for this one.  I did not know about the issue which Bruce Smith has sent (blue text, below) to Jenny and Bob McAuliffe.  When I spoke w/Jenny, I was unaware of BMC's retraction.  It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn't seem very "customer-focused" on BMC's part.  I certainly agree w/Bruce's statement to the effect that BMC needs to meet w/Philippe about their pricing!JKY

Jennifer,I had forgotten to invite Roy, but I did tell him about the meeting, and he was OK w/getting the notes after the fact.  I also told him I would not forget to keep him in the loop and invited to any future meetings.As for Ron Smith, I really have egg on my face.  I totally forgot about Ron (I was thinking only Instromet, and S-J was running with that).  I think that in my excitement and effort to get this meeting put together, I overlooked a few important details.  I will certainly do a better job next time!Thanks for the reminder!JYp.s. I was unable to get w/George during the day yesterday, but I did catch him at about 6:35pm.  I gave him my update on the latest BMC/EBS activities (Crowder is going to meet w/Philippe today).  He gave me some good feedback, and I think that for the most part, I'm on the right track.  The only thing I've done which I feel could provide (potential) negative exposure, based on feedback from George; is discussing w/BMC the idea that perhaps EBS could do the buy/take $1MM, and pay/keep credit of $2MM...I wasn't admonished, but KGW felt that I would have been better off not discussing that w/BMC...You and I can talk, though, because I'm not so sure that it was a bad thing, in this case.  But next time, there won't be a next time - so that won't be an issue anyway!
Meeting Minutes: Bristol Babcock, Pagosa Energy/Well Master, EBS, and GSSMeeting Purpose:  Business overview, solutions identification/brainstormingDate: 12/1/00EnronEBS Attendee:Anthony GilmoreGlobal Strategic Sourcing Attendee: Jeff YoungfleshBristol BabcockKevin FinnanJim GriffethPagosa Energy/Well MasterRob BenderDISCUSSION POINTS:1)  Bristol and Well Master feel that there is significant opportunity, with placement of enough BBI TeleFlow devices (integrated flow computer, corrector, recorder and controller/RTU) in North America that the data transmission needs would generate enough bandwidth demand that it would be of interest to EBS to provide some of its solutions to Bristol & Pagosa Energy "unified solutions" (quotes are mine - JKY) for the gas industry.  NOTE:  this could take a longer term to reach the necessary "critical status", due to the need for a very large hardware install base since each TeleFlow generates only about 11 - 12,000 bytes of data per day in its report bursts.1a)  In this scenario, the EBS opportunity would be primarily driven by sales of product solutions by BBI and Pagosa, which would include EBS network capacity.  (a "sell-through" effect for EBS)2)  There could also be enough demand for bandwidth- or related EBS solutions to Bristol by including Bristol's own internal I/T bandwidth consumption that a near-term solutions engagement would be desirable.  NOTE:  this could accelerate to the necessary "critical status", bringing to EBS more solutions demand due to the addition of "sell-to".  The "sell-through" effect would be present with Bristol/Pagosa selling solutions which use EBS' solutions (a sales "channel"), as well as EBS "sell-to" BBI & Pagosa for their own internal consumption of bandwidth.____________________________________________________________________ACTION ITEMS:  1)  Bristol will provide Anthony (Tony) Gilmore of Enron Broadband Services the necessary contact information for the appropriate people in FKI's (Bristol's parent co.) Info/Technology area.2) Enron GSS contacts (J Youngflesh) will attempt to ascertain if there would be value to Enron (GPG?) and/or its customers if they had the ability to execute nomination control all the way to the ground (upstream of gas well-head).3) EBS (Tony Gilmore) will begin working on the I/T discovery process, attempting to aggregate total Bandwidth demand: (usage patterns/volume/etc.) at Bristol and/or Pagosa.3a)  Per Rob Bender, Tony Gilmore should be contacting Al Freimeyer (sp?) at Pagosa to understand the volum of data from their daily batches from well-to-vendor.  Rob provided Tony Al's telephone number on 12/1.4)  Enron GSS to contact Ron Smith - waterSCADA.com - to investigate parallel opportunity (gas / water analog).5)  EBS and BBI/Pagosa will begin (internal efforts) to figure out ways of getting the TeleFlow CDPD data onto the EBS "Enron Intelligent Network"Next Meeting: TBDPlease let me know if I've missed anything.Thank you, JeffJeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716Bender Rob <rebende@earthlink.net>12/05/2000 08:50 AM  To: jeff.youngflesh@enron.com cc: Anthony_Gilmore@enron.net Subject: Meeting 12-1-00Dear Jeff:It was a pleasure meeting with you last Friday with Jim Griffith andKevin Finnan of Bristol Babcock.  Perhaps by now you have had anopportunity to review the  http://wells.pagosaenergy.com web site andlook at aspects of the "demo" section.  This is a very dynamic programwith changes, upgrades, and customization taking place all the time tomeet the individual needs of our customers.There may well be a good fit here as we are seeking ever faster means ofcommunication and will be requiring a substantial infrastructure notonly for communications but for data base hosting as well.  While yet inits infancy we have received very positive feedback and interest fromnumerous oil and gas companies in the industry.  An alliance with Enronto help us on the road to becoming the "Microsoft" of oil and gas wellautomation would be a very alluring prospect.  I would like to keep adialog going between us to scope out areas of mutual benefit for our twocompanies where such an alliance would make sense.I hope to hear from you soon.Sincerely,Rob Bender,President - PagosaEnergy.comrob@pagosaenergy.com
Thad,Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual meetings?  We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in NJ.  Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week.  However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible alignments and opportunities.  This would include two primary areas:1)  EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use:  what types of potential solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and2)  EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the (common) markets served:  "sell with" (each other); and "sell through" (channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as sales channels for each other's sales forces.These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value propositions, such that they would have a "jumping off point" for a go-to-market effort (item #2, above).  In addition, the technical aspects of some of the "EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use" (item #1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be addressed.Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days synchronized with your executives'.  Thank you,JeffJeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716
Karen,Thank you for the update.  It looks like we'll plan on having the EBS/Avaya meetings on January 10th and 11th, 2001.  The first day will be a full day, the second will be 1/2 day, a.m. session.  You have asked me to provide a list of Enron attendees, titles, which day(s) they would likely attend, and some background information on the meeting(s) purposes.  An explanation of the meetings' proposed focus and probable attendees is in the attached meeting notes.  The notes are from the November meeting which we coordinated and held for Enron Broadband Services and Dave Johnson.  By copy of this note to Kim Godfrey, we'll update the EBS executives on the meetings, and work on arranging their calendar availability.  So far, we have had the EBS execs' calendars penciled in for the time slot of January 9-11.  At this point, I would expect that the EBS attendee list would look something like this:  Jim Crowder, VP, Enterprise Services; Enron Broadband Services - day 2 Everett Plante, VP and CIO, Enron Broadband Services - day 2Larry Ciscon, VP Software Architecture, EBS - day 1&2  (selected team members of Larry's organization - individuals TBD by Larry) - day 1  Steve Pearlman, VP, Strategic Development, EBS - day 2 and/or day 1Kim Godfrey, Director, East Origination, EBS - day 1&2  Jeff Youngflesh, Director, Business Development, Enron Global Strategic Sourcing - day 1&2      (others as suggested by Kim Godfrey or other EBS executive)From Avaya, the EBS team would like to meet with Dave Johnson, Serge Minassian, John Stephenson, and their selected Avaya team members.  Per my conversation with you earlier today, the Enron Broadband Services meetings w/Avaya will need to be scheduled such that the overall agenda will "flip-flop" day 1 with day 2.  Originally, the first day was going to be a half-day executive strategizing meeting in the p.m. (allowing for travel to NJ), and the 2nd day to be more a product- or solutions-focused effort, with a full day's agenda.  Based on the fact that Dave Johnson will only be available the morning of the 11th, the meeting schedule will be reversed, such that the "full day/products/solutions" meetings will precede the half-day executive strategy sessions.  I have checked w/Barbara Korp, and Serge Minassian and John Stephenson are both available on the 11th, as well (John Stephenson would have a hard stop at 10:30).Thank you,Jeff Youngflesh713-345-5968

City Council soon will receive the contract for its approval. The administration of Mayor Lee Brown was believed to have favored Montgomery Watson's chief competitor, Azurix Corp., an arm of local energy giant Enron Corp. The water corporation, known as "the Hawk," voted 5-0 to grant the contract. If approved by City Council, the contract would give the company 2 1/2 years to get the plant up and treating raw lake water. It was initially expected that the plant, which will be designed to handle 40 million gallons of water daily, could cost as much as $150 million to build. The Hawk board asked the vying companies to modify their bids several times, and that caused the competitors to lower their prices. The contract calls for the Hawk to pay a monthly operating fee of $157,000 when the plant is working. And Montgomery Watson could be required to construct, at the Hawk's option, an additional 40 million-gallon-a-day plant expansion for $32 million. But the details of how the plant will be financed have not been determined. The Hawk board discussed borrowing money using the city's credit rating on a short-term basis until it could develop long-term financing by selling bonds itself. The initial customer for the water is the city of Houston, which would repay the Hawk the cost of producing the treated water. The hope is that the plant eventually will provide water to other entities in the area as well. This plant is part of an area plan for the treatment of surface water that could cost about $2 billion to implement. City Councilman Carroll Robinson, who heads the council infrastructure committee, said he expects to hold two hearings about the contract. One would focus on how the Hawk board picked Montgomery Watson. A series of three recommendations from City Hall staff recommended Azurix. Hawk board members said Montgomery Watson's prices were lower by millions and that Azurix plans to sell Azurix North America, the body that would oversee this contract. The second City Council hearing will focus on financing, Robinson said. "In my mind, how the city will pay for this construction is as important as who will do it," Robinson said. The Hawk board, appointed by Brown and approved by City Council, has been heavily lobbied by the contenders for the job. Because City Council does not have to follow the Hawk recommendation, new pressure has begun at City Hall. The third bidder, U.S. Filter Operating Services, part of a French company, has been heavily lobbying some council members to switch the contract to it. Some members of the Azurix team -- people at companies that would have gotten work had Azurix gotten the job -- have written letters complaining about the Hawk procedures as well. John M. Stokes, president and chief executive officer of Azurix, penned the first such distressed missive. In April, he wrote to Hawk board Chairman David Berg complaining of the "deleterious economic effect" on Azurix of the board's decision to negotiate with Montgomery Watson. He requested that Berg answer a series of questions in writing explaining why Azurix didn't get the job. Berg didn't do so. Although that letter had a threatening tone, Amanda Martin, president of Azurix North America, said no threat was intended and the letter simply indicated how upset the team was when it first learned Azurix wasn't chosen. Azurix was the rumored front-runner for months. INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: Enron may cut stake in Gulf gas project Financial Times; May 15, 2001By ROBIN ALLENThere are growing fears that Enron, the US power company, may withdraw or sharply reduce its stake in the Gulf's Dollars 10bn Dolphin gas export scheme, one of the most ambitious of its kind in the region. Enron officials have refused to comment on reports that the company is reconsidering its position as a minority shareholder in Dolphin Energy, in which France's TotalFinaElf (TFE) also has 24.5 per cent. However, one industry specialist said yesterday Enron was talking of "selling" at least part of its shareholding. The threat raises critical issues for western companies seeking to profit from accessing state-owned oil and gas in the Gulf. The project was launched two years ago by Abu Dhabi, the wealthiest of the United Arab Emirates, to promote energy security for the Gulf. But Abu Dhabiis seen as a prime example of a state where prestige and opaque domestic political considerations can be as important as profitability in such a large-scale project, especially in the early stages. Dolphin's majority owner is UAE's Offsets Group (UOG), an offshoot of Abu Dhabi's defence procurement industry. In March, Dolphin, a relative newcomer on Abu Dhabi's energy scene, signed a Dollars 3.5bn agreement with Qatar to exploit and pipe up to 2bn cubic feet a day of gas from Qatar's prolific North Field to Abu Dhabi. Qatari gas is the source of Abu Dhabi's long-term energy strategy, and Enron's role was to develop, at a profit, the downstream section, primarily to construct and lay the 350km pipeline from Qatar to Abu Dhabi. Enron is not a specialist in energy production or pipeline fabrication, but one of its main aims, according to one analyst, was to gain access to the gas accruing to it from the Qatar deal and then trade it on. Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan al-Nahyan, Abu Dhabi's ruler, disapproves of commodity trading. "If the Qatar-UAE gas deal was going to be profitable" for western energy majors, asked one senior western diplomat, "then why are the serious US energy majors not involved?" For more reports see www.ft.com/globaleconomy Copyright: The Financial Times LimitedJAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). "If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per year," Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high electricity rates. A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the international market. Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating its market in 1998. These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. "The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California," Kean said. North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process he said held many benefits. Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts said at an industry seminar Tuesday. The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in March 2000.However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies. "What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly," said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the University of Tokyo. Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users. "There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization," Hatta said. He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered once the prices are liberalized. "If power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using electricity." Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. (ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries following the liberalization. Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called "Reassessing Power Deregulation," which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. Hatta of the University of Tokyo said "it's very wise" that Japan has begun the deregulation with the "bilateral supply, or trade" system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly. Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market - is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers, Hatta said. Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates - regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs are levied on prices. "There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices" nationwide, Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233) management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with "strong back-up" from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. "Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select independent power providers," Omuro said. -By Maki Aoto, Dow Jones Newswires; 813-5255-2929; maki.aoto@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

SINGAPORE: ANALYSIS-No Asia fallout seen from Enron's India woes.By Cameron Dueck05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.SINGAPORE, May 15 (Reuters) - A bitter payment battle between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and authorities in India will serve as a reminder to foreign investors of the risks of putting money into emerging markets, analysts and bankers say. But it is unlikely to deter the flow of money into Asian electricity projects.The pace of power privatisation and deregulation varies too greatly from country to country for the controversy in India to chill investment activity across Asia, they say. It does, however, underline the risks companies take despite some security offered by government payment guarantees. "Independant power producers (IPPs) will see Enron and Dabhol as an illustration of the dangers and possible risks of investing in an emerging market, but it would be going too far to say that other markets will be adversely affected because of it," said Philip Jackson, a banker with JP Morgan Chase in Hong Kong. Enron is on the verge of bailing out of an almost completed $2.9 billion power project because of a decade-long dispute with the troubled Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) over pricing and unpaid bills. MSEB has fallen about six months behind in paying for electricity supplied by Dabhol Power Co, the Indian unit of Houston-based Enron. The utility said last month that it had repaid about $28.6 million of the $48.2 million outstanding. The board of Dabhol has authorised the management to stop selling power to MSEB if the dispute is not resolved. Local media reports earlier in May said Enron was pulling executives out of India and relocating them elsewhere. Dabhol has invoked payment guarantees issued by the state and federal governments, but neither has stepped forward to foot the bill. GOVERNMENT GUARANTEES Banks often demand sponsor or host government guarantees to lessen risk before financing energy projects, which have long lead times and high capital expenditure. Governments are keen to provide guarantees to attract foreign investment. Guarantees may cover shortfalls in production, default of customer payment or even changes in market conditions. But such guarantees do not always provide the desired safety net and analysts said the legal systems in many emerging nations are simply not efficient enough to back these agreements. Enron's experience in India highlighted the risks of power investment in emerging countries and the unpredictability of government guarantees, they said. "Guarantees like that are painful for companies and for polititicians they're even more so," said John Vautrain, vice president at Purvin & Gertz in Singapore. "If the call is substantial, it's going to be bad." Robert Booth, director of the Bardak Group in West Perth, Australia, was more pessimistic and reckoned some companies might take a lead from Enron and shy away from emerging Asian nations. "Investors will pull back from these countries until they see that there is a properly functioning legal system that gives them assurance if they have to call in a government guarantee," Booth said.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Saudi Won't Announce Winners Of Gas Projs Tue - Report05/15/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- Saudi Arabia's supreme petroleum council is expected to hold a meeting Tuesday evening, but it's unlikely to declare its choice of international oil companies to participate in downstream gas projects, Arabic al-Hayat newspaper reported. The newspaper quoted sources at the government's technical committee overseeing the proposed projects as saying that the committee hasn't completed its final report concerning the oil companies' offers."Studies and recommendations haven't been completed yet and they need some time in order to present the project at its final structure, attached with recommendations from the technical committee," the sources said, according to the newspaper. However, the oil council "might endorse some balances concerning the offers," the newspaper said but didn't elaborate further. Sources in Saudi Arabia have said the oil companies were expected to be notified soon on whether they have been selected to participate in the gas projects. Saudi Arabia invited international oil companies in October 1998 to participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas enhancement. After a series of meetings between the negotiating committee and the oil companies in the past year, several companies were shortlisted for each project. The companies shortlisted for Core Venture 1, the $15 billion South Ghawar Area Development were Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP), Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CHV), Total Fina Elf S.A. (TOT) and ENI SpA (E). For Core Venture 2, the Red Sea Development, Enron Corp. (ENE) and Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) are bidding jointly and Exxon Mobil, Total Fina Elf, Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (T.M), Shell and Conoco Inc. (COCA) were shortlisted. And for Core Venture 3, the Shaybah area, Total Fina Elf, Conoco, Phillips Petroleum (P), Enron and Occidental, Exxon Mobil, Shell and Marathon Oil were shortlisted. -By Abdulla Fardan, Dow Jones Newswires; 973-530758; abdullah.fardan@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

MSEB refutes allegations by Enron, DPCGirish Kuber05/15/2001The Economic TimesCopyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)MUMBAI THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board on Monday in a letter to Enron refuted all allegations made against it by the company while invoking the political force majeure.Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company on April 9 had invoked the political force majeure clause. DPC had indicated it was not in a position to fulfil its contractual obligations to MSEB because of political circumstances beyond its control. MSEB in a reply on Monday denied Enron's allegation of 'political circumstances' and said there was no reason why it should have felt insecure. "Such a step was necessary under the Power Purchase Agreement and related security documents to notify the board of 'certain events and to enforce our rights'," DPC had said. However, according to MSEB, such a step by DPC was uncalled for. For DPC, invoking the force majeure clause was necessary as 'certain events occurred that are beyond the reasonable control of the affected party (DPC)'. MSEB has expressed surprise in a letter on Monday. The energy major had dispatched the notice to MSEB, as an affected party, which had been subjected to "concerted, deliberate and politically motivated actions of state government, the Government of India and the Board, which will have a material and adverse effect on DPC's ability to perform obligations under PPA". "Given the cumulative effect of these political actions, DPC determined that the political force majeure declaration is an appropriate mechanism for providing that notice, and that is an appropriate and necessary step in protecting DPC and its stakeholders' rights," the statement added. However, for MSEB this was 'yet another move' from Enron to avoid paying Rs 402 crore penalty the MSEB has slapped on it for failing to supply electricity as per the agreement. MSEB, in today's letter, reiterated its suggestion to adjust December 2000 and Januray 2001 bills, against the Rs 800 crore penalty it has slapped on Enron for not supplying electricity as per demand. MSEB has refused to pay DPC's December 2000 and January 2001 bills worth Rs 213 crore.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Saudi Supreme Petrol Council meeting to decide on huge gas project bids05/15/2001Business RecorderCopyright (C) 2001 Business Recorder; Source: World Reporter (TM)RIYADH : Saudi Arabia's Supreme Petroleum Council (SPC) is holding meetings on bids by 12 foreign oil majors for three giant gas projects and should take a decision shortly, a top oil official said on Monday.

"It is not clear yet when the discussions will be completed and wham a final decision will be issued," added Suhaibani, who expected it to be soon. The meetings began two weeks ago.A senior foreign oil executive in the kingdom expected an answer to his firm's bid by the end of this week or the start of next week. "The SPC is holding a crucial meeting today (Monday) and tomorrow. bin were told we would get an answer to our proposals either this weekend or early next week," the executive told AFP. The negotiating committee made detailed recommendations after meeting with the representative of 12 international oil companies (IOCs) which are bidding for the three multi-billion projects, the executive said. The committee, comprising ministers who are also SPC members, is headed by Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal. The gas projects, which would be the first foreign investment in the kingdom's energy sector since nationalisation in 1961, are located in the South Ghawar field near Al-Hufuf in the Eastern Province, Shaybah in the Empty Quarter desert, and the northern Red Sea area. They cover 440,000 square kilometres (176,000 square miles), making it the world's largest area for hydrocarbon investment. US majors Enron and Occidental in a joint bid, as well as Chevron, Conocokilometres, ExxonMobil, Marathon, Phillips and Texaco have been shortlisted for the Saudi projects. Rounding out the list are European firms BP Amoco, Eni, Royal Dutch Shell and TotalFinaElf. ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalFinaElf are in the bidding for all three ventures. The investment involves gas exploration and production, setting up petrochemical industries and power and water desalination plants. The projects, called the natural gas initiative, are to be carried out simultaneously by consortia of two to three firms in cooperation with Aramco, the national oil company, on long-term basis for up to 30 years, the executive said. Aramco has been working to double the Saudi gas network's capacity from the current 3.5 billion cubic feet (105 million cubic metres) per day to seven billion cubic feet (210 million metres) daily in 2004. Saudi Arabia, which sits on top of the world's biggest oil reserves, has proven natural gas reserves of 220 trillion cubic feet (6.6 trillion cubic metres).-AFPCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The voting will take place through conference calls criss-crossing the globe at 6.30 pm, Indian Standard Time. Even though the three Indian lenders_ the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI_ have decided to vote against the proposition, they will not be able to block the move.Technically, the proposal can be passed if four per cent of lenders are in favour of the termination notice. In effect, it will be passed if one of the 25 lenders casts its vote in favour of it. So, it's almost a foregone conclusion that DPC will be asked to issue its termination notice. Multilateral agency J-Exim, which has provided guarantees, will not participate in the exercise. Barring J-Exim, other financial intermediaries including global arrangers ABN Amro, Citi, ANZIB, CSFB and other banks and OPIC will cast their votes tomorrow. "In the first round, Indian lenders put their foot down and refused to give clearance to the termination notice. Thistime around they will not be able to block the move any more. The Indian lenders alone cannot save the controversial $3 billion as some of the foreign lenders are in favour of issuing the termination notice," said a source. The Indian lenders are in favour of completing the project without any time and cost over-run. They have disbursed about 80 per cent of their Rs 1,500 crore worth of loan commitments to phase II of the project, 93 per cent of which is complete. The trial run is expected to commence in June. The board of the Dabhol Power Company has already authorised Enron India managing director, K Wade Cline, to serve a termination notice as and when he deems fit. At a meeting of the lenders last month in London, the foreign lenders were keen that the termination notice be served in the face of defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the Union government's refusal to honour the counter-guarantee of Rs 102 crore for the December bill. The domestic lenders are not covered by the counter-guarantee if the contract is terminated. The foreign lenders are covered by the counter-guarantee.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

USA: Sempra unit to boost natgas delivery to California.05/15/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.SAN FRANCISCO, May 15 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas Co. (SCG) said in a statement on Tuesday it will add around 200 million cubic feet a day, or about six percent, to its pipeline system by the end of the year in order to meet the surge in demand for gas-fired power generation. Today's announcement comes two months after SCG, a unit of Sempra Energy , proposed to increase capacity on its system by 175 mmcfd, or five percent.Both projects will add around 11 percent of new gas capacity to its transmission system this year, the company said in a statement. In its latest proposal, called the Kramer Junction Interconnect, SCG said it would build a 32-mile pipeline link to the Kern-Mojave pipeline system that will allow it to deliver around 200 mmcfd into its system. The new capacity would be enough to drive three 500-megawatt power plants or enough gas to serve 1.4 million residential customers a day, the statement said. SCG, the nation's largest gas utility with more 18 million consumers in central and Southern California, said utilization of its intrastate transmission system in the past nine months had jumped from 75 percent to over 95 percent, due largely to the rise in gas-fired power generation. The company's announcement is the latest in several proposals to expand gas pipeline capacity to California, where demand for gas is expected to jump because of the number of gas-fired power plants being built or scheduled for construction. Gas is already used to generate about a third of California's electricity. And since April 1999, the state has approved 13 major gas-fired power plant projects with a combined generation capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. Nine gas-fired power plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 6,000 megawatts, are under construction. Over the past two months plans to build or expand gas lines serving California have been announced by Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' Kern River Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave Pipeline Co., Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. unit National Energy Group, Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. , and Kinder Morgan .Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei05/15/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. (ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said.At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant benefits to end-users. New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia." In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a company official. Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business interest. Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power generation facilities, Enron says. Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

(NGX), a wholly owned subsidiary of OM AB (OM), today announced that an arrangement has been made with Enron Canada Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron Corp. (Enron), whereby trading data from certain contracts listed on Enron's online trading system, EnronOnline will be included in the computation of three Alberta Gas Price Indices. NGX acquired the AECO "C" & NIT Daily Spot, One-Month Spot, and Bid-Week Spot gas price indices (Alberta Gas Price Indices) from Canadian Enerdata Ltd. last September. Subsequent to the acquisition of the Alberta Gas Price Indices, NGX has provided real-time information to its customers on the establishment of the weighted average price indices based on transactions conducted through NGX's trading system. Canadian Enerdata Limited continues to publish the Alberta Gas Price Indices in the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.Peter Krenkel, President of NGX, stated, "We believe that inclusion of data from EnronOnline will serve to make our price indices among the best in North America. The industry has been very supportive of the visibility and integrity we are able to bring to the Alberta Gas Price Indices, which removes the guesswork around gas price index methodology. However, after reviewing the matter with Enron and other industry participants, we recognized that Enron had legitimate concerns and the industry felt that "more is better". The inclusion of data from the highly liquid EnronOnline system should improve the quality of our price indices even further." Rob Milnthorp, President and CEO of Enron Canada commented, "We are very pleased to have EnronOnline transactions included in the Alberta Gas Price Indices. This will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price indices as they are now assured that all their transactions on EnronOnline will be included in the computation of the Alberta Price Indices." The inclusion of EnronOnline data satisfies the principal claims made by Enron in their legal action against NGX, Canadian Enerdata Ltd., OM and Richard Zarzeczny and Enron has agreed to discontinue the legal action against those parties with the conclusion of this arrangement. NGX and Enron are planning to implement the necessary system changes by August 1, 2001 but in any event will provide at least thirty days notice to the industry. Once in operation, data from transactions in the relevant contracts listed on EnronOnline will be fed to NGX in real-time. The methodology for computing the Alberta Gas Price Indices will continue to be on a weighted-average basis. NGX will engage independent auditors to insure full compliance with the Index Methodology Guide. This guide is available on NGX's website at www.ngx.com.

UAE To Seek New Partners If Enron Exits Dolphin Gas Proj05/15/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- If U.S.-based Enron Corp. (ENE) pulls out of the $3.5 billion Dolphin gas project, in which the company holds a 24.5% stake, the U.A.E. Offsets Group, or UOG, will consider other companies to replace it, a United Arab Emirates industry source close to the project said Tuesday. Industry sources Monday said Enron is considering withdrawing from the project because it doesn't believe it will be profitable.Dolphin, an agreement signed two years ago by UOG and Qatar Petroleum, plans to bring 2 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas from Qatar's offshore North Field to Abu Dhabi and onward to Dubai. Enron and TotalFinaElf (TOT) each hold a 24.5% stake in the project, while UOG owns the remaining 51%. Enron is set to focus on the midstream part of the project - gas transportation - which requires building a 350-kilometer pipeline from a processing plant in Ras Laffan, Qatar, to the Taweelah terminal in Abu Dhabi and the Jebel Ali terminal in Dubai. The U.A.E. source said originally, it was thought that the U.A.E. government would fund the pipeline, which is estimated to cost around $1 billion. However, more recently, the source said the U.A.E. suggested that Enron put up the money itself. Other industry sources said Enron and TotalFinaElf also had to pay significant fees to join the project. TotalFinaElf willoperate the upstream part of the project, which includes developingnatural gas reserves in two blocks of the North Field. First wells are scheduled to be drilled in the second half of 2001 and come onstream in 2005. Last week, the Middle East Economic Survey reported that the foreign partners haven't yet agreed on the precise details of their working relationship or on the price of the pipeline. Qatar Petroleum and Dolphin Energy Ltd., a subsidiary of UOG, signed an initial agreement in March for the upstream section of the project. A full agreement is expected to be concluded in September, the source said. -By Dyala Sabbagh, Dow Jones Newswires; 9714 331 4260; dyala.sabbagh@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)2001-05-15 16:35 (New York)Enron Should Sell Utility to Oregon, Lawmaker Argues (Update2)     (Updates with closing share prices.)     Washington, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. should sellPortland General Electric Co. to Oregon so state consumers can beinsulated from soaring electricity prices, a congressman said.     ``Purchasing PGE would give Oregon ratepayers more control bykeeping its assets in Oregon, accountable solely to Oregonians,''U.S. Representative Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Springfield,Oregon, said in a letter to Governor John Kitzhaber.     The governor is considering DeFazio's proposal, saidKitzhaber spokesman Kevin Smith.     Last month, Houston-based Enron, the biggest energy trader,agreed to cancel the $3.1 billion sale of Portland General, autility with more than 700,000 Oregon customers, to Sierra PacificResources of Reno, Nevada.     Enron and Sierra Pacific blamed laws spawned by high powerprices and electricity shortages in the West for the sale'scollapse.     ``We are pleased to keep Portland General in our assetportfolio because it's a solid earnings performer,'' Enronspokeswoman Karen Denne said. ``If approached by a buyer whorecognizes its value, we'd consider selling it.'' She declined tocomment on a potential bid by Oregon.     The state should act swiftly, DeFazio said, citing pressreports that the U.K.'s Scottish Power Plc, owner of PacifiCorp,the largest utility in the U.S Northwest, may bid for PortlandGeneral.     Scottish Power, based in Glasgow, Scotland, would have morethan 70 percent of Oregon electricity customers if it addedPortland General, raising ``serious regulatory concerns aboutmarket power,'' he said.                            Bond Issue     Oregon could issue bonds to purchase Portland General, usingthe utility's profits to pay the debt, DeFazio said. The statemight run it as a public utility or a cooperative, he said.     Enron and Sierra Pacific called off the Portland General salebecause of laws passed by Nevada and California legislators thatslow the deregulation of their wholesale power markets.     California and Nevada have blocked sales of power plants byutilities. Sierra Pacific had to sell a stake in a Nevada powerplant that sells power to California to win regulatory approval ofthe Portland General purchase.     Average power prices on the California-Oregon border thisyear have soared ninefold to $296.34 a megawatt hour over the year-earlier period. A megawatt hour can light 750 average Californiahomes for an hour.     Shares of Enron fell $1.76 to $$56.99. They've fallen 31percent this year.     Sierra Pacific rose 9 cents to $16.09. Scottish Power rose 9pence to 492 ($7) in London.Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)2001-05-15 16:26 (New York)Enron to Provide Gas Prices to NGX, Drops Lawsuit (Update1)     (Adds closing share price.)     Houston, May 15 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world'sbiggest energy trader, agreed to provide natural-gas pricinginformation to NGX Canada Inc. and drop a C$100 million($64.7 million) suit against the Canadian gas exchange.     Enron sued NGX in November after the Internet exchange, aunit of the company that owns the Stockholm Stock Exchange,changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't includetrades on EnronOnline, Enron's Internet exchange, when calculatinggas-price indexes.     Calgary-based NGX agreed to include EnronOnline trades incalculating its Alberta Gas Price Indices by August, Enronspokesman Eric Thode said.     NGX, owned by Stockholm's OM Gruppen AB, is used by about 90percent of Canadian gas traders, and many traders use EnronOnlineto sell gas from western Canada, the biggest supplier of thecleaner-burning fuel to the U.S.     Houston-based Enron fell $1.76 to $56.99.

And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus this year, a flashlight. As state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during California's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the 31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts may disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday.''People here are used to interruptions,'' Sara Abbas, 21, a senior communications major, said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus. ''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot. People have cut the power lines. They just reschedule.'' In an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R. Gray, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the disposition of their examinations once the exam has started.'' Among the options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether. Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms have windows. ''In some classrooms,'' Mr. Gray noted, ''students may have sufficient natural light.'' The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of California and California State University. The two systems are embroiled in a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to the universities. For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. Though several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert. At Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress levels. ''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because I save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a sophomore majoring in political science. Aaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively, planning to return later with more care. ''The only thing I don't have a problem with is if the professors give everyone A's,'' Mr. Chung, 23, said. ''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.'' Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on the grass. But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the final counts for only 20 percent of the grade. That is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class, is hoping for. ''I would love a blackout,'' Ms. Chen said. ''I'm going to turn on my air-conditioner. My toaster, too.''Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BusinessBritish TelecomPatience Wheatcroft05/12/2001The Times of LondonNews InternationalFinal 455(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year. But others are still lining up to put the boot in. Hours after the company announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating. This thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans as well as making future working capital more expensive. The timing is odd. One of the two other main agencies presented with the same BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that change-of-rating clauses were not triggered. In the meantime, the market prices of BT debt have been rising. The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February. Such costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies, whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.Moody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the whims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities. Moody's will no doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a result. In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms. The Office of Fair Trading has reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up. The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking. But it appears to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too much, so prices should fall further. The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum. This sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation. It must strengthen the resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the greater advantage of shareholders.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. OUTLOOKOutlookHouston needs to think small about future technologyWILLIAM DYLAN POWELL05/13/2001Houston Chronicle2 STAR4(Copyright 2001)OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook readers. Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone mentions Houston? Time's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random acts of highway closure. But how about something very, very small? While Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature. As technology advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular scale (the prefix "nano" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power numerically). Its theories and practices give scientists the means to construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered matter. Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback, you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises. The possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories that could fit neatly on your desk. Cancer-destroying robots could roam a patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration. Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated. And all manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the environment and from a business process standpoint. Sound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with fiction. A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a functional switch out of a single organic molecule. Discoveries such as these have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS (nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine. This technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affect Houston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's economic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds. And the energy industry, still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities of nanotech. This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic development. Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two separate fronts. First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain; and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering, nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies). But too much technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities. Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister to the north. The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye on developments in small science. In March, a private-sector company donated $2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research. And a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of their own. This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology. Houston has its own projects, but they receive far less publicity. Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice University's grand Turks of academia. Pushing the envelope of academic excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting technology. But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity and support than other less commercially significant disciplines. On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends that will affect Houston's future. Will the keynote speakers (chief executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its potential economic impact on the region? I certainly hope so. Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of Houston's economy. Each of these industry sectors could reap profound benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light. Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off. But it's going to become remarkably important sooner than we think. So while Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think small. Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to our city and its economic development.Drawing Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. APanel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of life top group's list of needed improvementsMIKE SNYDERStaff05/13/2001Houston Chronicle4 STAR33(Copyright 2001)A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base. The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever they choose.Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn enrich the lives of every Houstonian. "The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests of the community at large," said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future. A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have discouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20 years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of successors. The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role in Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined. "Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of Houston," the report states. "But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter how benevolent those leaders might be." The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer, president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership. Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf. "They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool around with something that is ill-conceived," he said. Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's work could be very influential. "This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the part of the business community" to improve Houston's quality of life, Klineberg said. The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier business organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future. Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people representing a cross section of the business community. These 10-day, seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston scenarios. James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative" and are not necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However, they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said. In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power. Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax rate increase. Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year hardship post on the way to something more desirable." Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in turn leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007. These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or technical training programs. The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they would be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent on more traditional educational programs. In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically competitive. These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and public transport in corridors that delight the eye." Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate pedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail lines extending in various directions. To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt "new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city centers. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city." Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy." The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns its energy toward diversifying the economy. The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly become significant global players. The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city in which to live and conduct business." Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such as education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to begin translating these ideas into policy, they said. Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce results as soon as possible. "If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute. "We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure that we educate these kids for our future."Mugs: 1. Ken Lay (p. 45); 2. Ned Holmes (p. 45); 3. James Royer (p. 45); 4.

MSEB not to pick up 15 pc in DPC after phase II completion05/13/2001Press Trust of India Limited(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol. "It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the phase II of the project", a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday.Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB -15 per cent, General Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each. However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard, the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the completion of the project. DPC's USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus marking completion of the 2,184 MW project. DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEB's equity. The company had decided to off load the 15 per cent of its current holding of 65 per cent to a new entity, as according to the company's global debt-consolidation it needed to maintain its stake at 50 per cent in DPC after its completion. In order to avoid any delay, Enron had agreed to meet up with the equity shortfall as per the former's agreement with its lenders. (THROUGH ASIA PULSE) 13-05 2001Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron plans to pull out of Gulf gas project: MEED05/13/2001Agence France-Presse(Copyright 2001)DUBAI, May 13 (AFP) - Enron Corp. of the United States plans to pull out of a project to deliver Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) reported on Sunday. Enron is a partner in the Dolphin Energy project along with the Franco-Belgian company TotalFinaElf and the Abu Dhabi government- owned UAE Offsets Group (UOG). Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi."The profit margin for Enron would be low. At present, the Dolphin project is being developed primarily as an upstream venture," an industry source told MEED. Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as too high. "There is talk of new partners," a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED. "But whatever happens, we are staying." On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic metres) of natural gas per day. Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999. According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following "high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi". TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake. From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to Dubai and Oman. An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also planned, as part of a regional gas network. hc/rpCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESSSMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what amounts to limo service on the lakeCAROL RUSTSpecial to the Chronicle05/13/2001Houston Chronicle2 STAR1(Copyright 2001)KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden box he'd made at school. "This is my houseboat," he told his mother 35 years ago. "When I grow up, I'm going to live on a boat."His practical-minded mother put the "boat" to work as a patio plant stand until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure. On a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay. "This is what I love," Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant boats. "The others are here to party, but this is it for me." The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party for a major customer. A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her neck. In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year. Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme. One guy recently plunked down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date. One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings. Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as regular on-board equipment. "It's a bizarre business," Lober said. "Nothing seems unusual anymore." Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina, transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The galley crew does the final cooking. Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but Lober has hundreds of competitors locally. "I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating, drinking and party business," he said. "People say there are two things you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on a boat." Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a 30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a limo does on land. Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiters deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake. Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in Trinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981. But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat to providing exclusive entertainment on the water. In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism or other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners, researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take to float his idea. Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150 passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay. "I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five feet deep in places, he said. Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan. "This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober said. "They had no confidence. "I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and tell me what it needs,' " he said. Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week, he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up. After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60 percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar engines on the boat. Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair. Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993. The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but it didn't prepare him for marketing. "I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent $125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that he called "a total flop." Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell, he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a time. Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental, insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave once," he said. Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he got one: target marketing. He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy Mills mall. "We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif. "The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before. Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back." Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth, the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future. "We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the other boats," he said. After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting everything back into the business. The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate. But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers. "We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said. It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other locations on the Houston Ship Channel. If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor causes the player to bounce. Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's stanchions into palm trees. And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being honored at a recent floating awards banquet. Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back. "They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something different. We provide a different kind of party. If they do it once, they usually want to do it again." But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes. About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company has chosen to have with Star Fleet. Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are. "It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston. Even in Clear Lake, there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can actually see the water. We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor. So people have to be reminded." He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford cruises, Lober said. "Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities, country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said. "And our food is gourmet quality. Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut corners." Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax and gratuities. Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks. "We learn a lot from our customers," he said. "We see what they do, take the best and give it back to them." Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers moving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375 guests. But one boat can still do a lot of advertising. At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him. As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge under construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes - the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment. It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from school years ago, Lober says. And he's going to live at the top.Photos: 1-2.

More power to reform agendaSoma Banerjee05/13/2001The Economic TimesCopyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)THE electricity industry is often identified as the black sheep in the infrastructure sector which has continued to lag behind despite an overdose of government support. Despite being one of the earlier industries to be opened up, private investments in this sector have failed to take off.Worse, the only sizeable project which was something to write home about Enrons Dabhol Power plant in Maharashtra is currently a under cloud with its promoters involved in a legal battle with the state entity and its sole consumer for non-payment of bills. Policy makers and investors in the energy sector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of this key industry. Although private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating new capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health of the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power plant developers. After about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit only about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in greenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years. The factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection are almost inbuilt into the system. For one, there is a general agreement that stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution front has eroded the financial health of most SEBs. ``Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they are assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say. But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before they break even. The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron too says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry. IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it difficult for investors to take decisions. ``Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for eight projects, of which only three have taken off. Of this the Enron project is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source. According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs have registered a negative turnover. Which is why the financing or escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero. According to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results. But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that can help this backbencher.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit PossibleBy Himendra KumarOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES05/12/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu said. In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project.A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another meeting May 23. Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours. "I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes," Prabhu said. Earlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron Vice President John Ambler however, said, "While we have constantly maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract." The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9 billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs. A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel, recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated. Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer, failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each. -By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427; himendra.kumar@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. India: Talks begin on Dabhol issue05/12/2001Business Line (The Hindu)Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence WireMUMBAI, May 11. OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power Company. Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice.Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away. Instead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development Bank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting. When asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: "They are coming again on May 23. What does that mean?" Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details, senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the rebate slapped on DPC. "Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by DPC to the centre-stage," the official said. "The company has not mentioned a single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or the State. And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate in our letters to DPC," he said. Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the company would issue the preliminary termination notice. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their stand vis-a-vis Enron. They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project. They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is learnt. MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it against the non-performance penalty. Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice issued by DPC and made its position clear. The board is of the opinion that DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default. The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three arbitration notices served on it. It has said that since MSEB does not accept the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) - leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay. The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to the conciliation notice from DPC. Today's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC, Mr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and Mr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC. Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend. The next meeting is scheduled on May 23, Mr Lal said. Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr Harish Salve's candidature for the job. The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third conciliator is yet to be appointed. Dabhol Power Company had written to the Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process. DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators. Soon after the conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the project.

India to allow 3rd party sale if DPC, MSEB jointly approach05/12/2001Press Trust of India Limited(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) The Federal Government will allow sale of power to a "willing buyer" if the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will together approach the power ministry with a concrete proposal for their 2,184 mw project in Dabhol. "I will give whatever status they want, including a mega project one, if DPC and MSEB jointly approach the Centre (Federal Government) for the same", Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters here Saturday.He said the Indian Government would extend its cooperation to the Maharashtra government (western state) "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between MSEB and DPC. When pointed out that both the state government and DPC were of the opinion that federal power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should buy the power, Prabhu said NTPC cannot do so as it was power selling entity and not buying one. "There is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed by NTPC with the buying states", he reiterated. Prabhu said the Indian Government would also try and find out potential buyers of DPC power "if other states were willing to buy the same". Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 300-400 MW needed for the state from the 740 MW phase-I and soon to be commissioned phase-II of 1,444 MW, to other needy states.

LOCAL STORIESDEFAZIO CALLS FOR STATE TO BUY PGE TO PROTECT RATESDAVE HOGAN AND JEFF MAPES of the Oregonian Staff05/12/2001Portland OregonianSUNRISEC01(Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)Summary: The suggestion generates little enthusiasm and critics suspect it's motivated by the lawmaker's possible race for governor "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale markets." -- U.S. REP. PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.The state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market, U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday. Gov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but others said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing factors. Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else. Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon. "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore. PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month. Other possible buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp. While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea. "I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this time," said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. He said the state already has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and conservation. Senate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and talk with DeFazio. "I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't plan to devote much work to the proposal. Derfler questioned whether state government could run a utility as efficiently as a business. DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway corporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would provide some protection and stability in electricity rates. It also would be a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back into the state's coffers. The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state. DeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was "in the realm of possibility." DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE. Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to publicly owned utilities. However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity sales contracts that already are in place. And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks said. In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower. The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE, but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly owned utilities. He also said it seemed designed to get political attention for DeFazio's potential candidacy. "I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of those," Eachus said. DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with his plan.

BEGGSAssociated Press Writer05/11/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs. The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber, who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000 customers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets." DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and have the utility operate as a public power entity. He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources. "While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation. Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility. Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion, citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political environment in the West. Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private utility, as long as it would benefit consumers. DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville Power Administration's hydropower. The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature. "Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons. "Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said. "We have a bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue." Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating plants. Senate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job like a utility purchase.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

After our meeting with Dell on 10/27, I sent a request to Charlie Ball (works for Kip) for detailed power data from TXU. Charlie delegated the task of getting this data to Randy Don Carlos, who has yet to return any of my calls to update the status of the request.Charlie Ball left me a message this morning indicating that Randy Don Carlos was leaving Dell at the end of the month. He indicated that he will get the information to me as soon as he can. I'm not sure, but it seems that no one has sent the request to TXU yet. TXU generally will send out data within 1-2 weeks of a request. It has now been 6 weeks since we asked Dell for the data. Assuming Charlie actually gets someone to send the data request to TXU, we should get something by the end of the year.Similarly, Continental has not yet sent over data that they were to request from HL&P. I talked with someone in Mark's group on 12/4, and she indicated that they had the data, but their real estate group wanted to review it before they sent it to us. On this one also, it is unlikely that any transaction will get done in this calendar year.Please call if you have any questions.
Hey, I meant to check in with you and see how your dinner went at La Columbe d'Or.   I have to admit, I was jealous....Matt fell through as the Christmas party date...so Noel is going (so nice to have friends who don't mind filling in as last minute dates!).  Maybe we'll see you guys there.Had fun hanging out with you at/after the meeting on Friday.  I think that's the most I've ever talked to you in one sitting!!  We'll have to do it again soon....Take care!Amy
Conference Room TBD.  This meeting will be to discuss opportunity for EBS to provide the network for BBI's well-site reporting systems to send their data across.  Maybe VBN/IPNetConnect application?

And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus this year, a flashlight. As state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during California's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the 31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts may disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday.''People here are used to interruptions,'' Sara Abbas, 21, a senior communications major, said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus. ''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot. People have cut the power lines. They just reschedule.'' In an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R. Gray, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the disposition of their examinations once the exam has started.'' Among the options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether. Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms have windows. ''In some classrooms,'' Mr. Gray noted, ''students may have sufficient natural light.'' The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of California and California State University. The two systems are embroiled in a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to the universities. For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. Though several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert. At Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress levels. ''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because I save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a sophomore majoring in political science. Aaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively, planning to return later with more care. ''The only thing I don't have a problem with is if the professors give everyone A's,'' Mr. Chung, 23, said. ''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.'' Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on the grass. But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the final counts for only 20 percent of the grade. That is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class, is hoping for. ''I would love a blackout,'' Ms. Chen said. ''I'm going to turn on my air-conditioner. My toaster, too.''Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BusinessBritish TelecomPatience Wheatcroft05/12/2001The Times of LondonNews InternationalFinal 455(Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 2001)BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year. But others are still lining up to put the boot in. Hours after the company announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating. This thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans as well as making future working capital more expensive. The timing is odd. One of the two other main agencies presented with the same BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that change-of-rating clauses were not triggered. In the meantime, the market prices of BT debt have been rising. The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February. Such costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies, whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.Moody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the whims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities. Moody's will no doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a result. In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms. The Office of Fair Trading has reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up. The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking. But it appears to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too much, so prices should fall further. The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum. This sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation. It must strengthen the resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the greater advantage of shareholders.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. OUTLOOKOutlookHouston needs to think small about future technologyWILLIAM DYLAN POWELL05/13/2001Houston Chronicle2 STAR4(Copyright 2001)OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook readers. Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone mentions Houston? Time's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random acts of highway closure. But how about something very, very small? While Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature. As technology advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular scale (the prefix "nano" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power numerically). Its theories and practices give scientists the means to construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered matter. Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback, you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises. The possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories that could fit neatly on your desk. Cancer-destroying robots could roam a patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration. Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated. And all manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the environment and from a business process standpoint. Sound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with fiction. A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a functional switch out of a single organic molecule. Discoveries such as these have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS (nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine. This technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affect Houston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's economic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds. And the energy industry, still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities of nanotech. This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic development. Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two separate fronts. First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain; and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering, nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies). But too much technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities. Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister to the north. The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye on developments in small science. In March, a private-sector company donated $2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research. And a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of their own. This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology. Houston has its own projects, but they receive far less publicity. Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice University's grand Turks of academia. Pushing the envelope of academic excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting technology. But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity and support than other less commercially significant disciplines. On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends that will affect Houston's future. Will the keynote speakers (chief executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its potential economic impact on the region? I certainly hope so. Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of Houston's economy. Each of these industry sectors could reap profound benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light. Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off. But it's going to become remarkably important sooner than we think. So while Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think small. Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to our city and its economic development.Drawing Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. APanel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of life top group's list of needed improvementsMIKE SNYDERStaff05/13/2001Houston Chronicle4 STAR33(Copyright 2001)A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base. The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever they choose.Creating such a "livable city," leaders of the effort say, would in turn enrich the lives of every Houstonian. "The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests of the community at large," said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future. A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have discouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20 years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public education, "livable city centers" have changed the physical landscape and current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of successors. The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role in Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of business influence that prevailed in "the old days" should be re-examined. "Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of Houston," the report states. "But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter how benevolent those leaders might be." The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer, president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the Greater Houston Partnership. Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf. "They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool around with something that is ill-conceived," he said. Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's work could be very influential. "This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the part of the business community" to improve Houston's quality of life, Klineberg said. The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier business organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future. Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people representing a cross section of the business community. These 10-day, seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston scenarios. James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined in the four scenarios are intended to be "illustrative" and are not necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However, they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said. In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power. Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax rate increase. Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the gap between rich and poor widens: "For many who live there, it's simply a large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year hardship post on the way to something more desirable." Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system by developing a "Teacher Network" that delivers Internet-based educational resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in turn leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007. These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or technical training programs. The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they would be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent on more traditional educational programs. In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically competitive. These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of "livable city centers" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through "personal and public transport in corridors that delight the eye." Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate pedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail lines extending in various directions. To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome their "ingrained suspicion of planning," and the City Council must adopt "new, more prescriptive development standards" within the livable city centers. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the "livable city." Scenario four focuses on making Houston a "crossroads of the world economy." The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns its energy toward diversifying the economy. The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly become significant global players. The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a "true world-class city in which to live and conduct business." Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such as education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to begin translating these ideas into policy, they said. Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce results as soon as possible. "If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs," Calaway said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute. "We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure that we educate these kids for our future."Mugs: 1. Ken Lay (p. 45); 2. Ned Holmes (p. 45); 3. James Royer (p. 45); 4.

MSEB not to pick up 15 pc in DPC after phase II completion05/13/2001Press Trust of India Limited(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol. "It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the phase II of the project", a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday.Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB -15 per cent, General Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each. However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard, the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the completion of the project. DPC's USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus marking completion of the 2,184 MW project. DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEB's equity. The company had decided to off load the 15 per cent of its current holding of 65 per cent to a new entity, as according to the company's global debt-consolidation it needed to maintain its stake at 50 per cent in DPC after its completion. In order to avoid any delay, Enron had agreed to meet up with the equity shortfall as per the former's agreement with its lenders.

Enron plans to pull out of Gulf gas project: MEED05/13/2001Agence France-Presse(Copyright 2001)DUBAI, May 13 (AFP) - Enron Corp. of the United States plans to pull out of a project to deliver Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Middle East Economic Digest (MEED) reported on Sunday. Enron is a partner in the Dolphin Energy project along with the Franco-Belgian company TotalFinaElf and the Abu Dhabi government- owned UAE Offsets Group (UOG). Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between Qatar and Abu Dhabi."The profit margin for Enron would be low. At present, the Dolphin project is being developed primarily as an upstream venture," an industry source told MEED. Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as too high. "There is talk of new partners," a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED. "But whatever happens, we are staying." On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic metres) of natural gas per day. Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999. According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following "high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi". TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake. From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to Dubai and Oman. An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also planned, as part of a regional gas network. hc/rpCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. BUSINESSSMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what amounts to limo service on the lakeCAROL RUSTSpecial to the Chronicle05/13/2001Houston Chronicle2 STAR1(Copyright 2001)KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden box he'd made at school. "This is my houseboat," he told his mother 35 years ago. "When I grow up, I'm going to live on a boat."His practical-minded mother put the "boat" to work as a patio plant stand until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure. On a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay. "This is what I love," Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant boats. "The others are here to party, but this is it for me." The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party for a major customer. A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her neck. In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year. Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme. One guy recently plunked down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date. One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings. Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as regular on-board equipment. "It's a bizarre business," Lober said. "Nothing seems unusual anymore." Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina, transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The galley crew does the final cooking. Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but Lober has hundreds of competitors locally. "I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating, drinking and party business," he said. "People say there are two things you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on a boat." Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a 30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a limo does on land. Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiters deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake. Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in Trinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981. But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat to providing exclusive entertainment on the water. In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism or other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners, researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take to float his idea. Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150 passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay. "I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake," which is five feet deep in places, he said. Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan. "This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before," Lober said. "They had no confidence. "I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and tell me what it needs,' " he said. Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week, he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up. After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60 percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar engines on the boat. Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St. Clair. Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993. The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but it didn't prepare him for marketing. "I didn't know what I was doing," Lober said. "The first year, I spent $125,000 in marketing blunders," including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that he called "a total flop." Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell, he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a time. Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental, insurance and slip fees, and "I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave once," he said. Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he got one: target marketing. He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy Mills mall. "We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years," said Ravi Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif. "The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before. Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back." Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth, the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still undeveloped, it eventually will become a parking lot for 500 cars when Lober adds a fifth large yacht, Star Ship, sometime in the future. "We plan to add Star Ship when we're turning down enough business from the other boats," he said. After more than eight years, Lober has yet to take home a salary, putting everything back into the business. The more he puts back, the more business he can accommodate. But Lober and his staff still keep close tabs on their customers. "We track everything - which individuals, what type of event, whether they prefer sit-down dinners, how they heard about us - you name it," he said. It's a lot of details. He knows that blackout shades, pull-down projector screens and multiple microphone jacks are needed for presentations, and that some clients like to be picked up at one of the Galveston hotels or other locations on the Houston Ship Channel. If a customer hires a deejay, a crewmember provides padding to put underneath the CD player on the bandstand because dancing on the steel dance floor causes the player to bounce. Lober's three full-time cruise consultants handle charter buses to and from the marina, limos, menus, photographers and decorations. They work with Star Fleet's in-house florist and theme designer to provide floral arrangements for sit-down dinners and Hawaiian leis of fresh orchids and hibiscus for a major retailer's party, for which the florist helped transform the boat's stanchions into palm trees. And consultants have their own suggestions, such as bestowing captains' hats instead of the usual corsages to employees with top sales who were being honored at a recent floating awards banquet. Lober believes his company's custom service brings customers back. "They handle all the details once, and after customers go on that first cruise, they're sold on the concept," he said. "People love something different. We provide a different kind of party. If they do it once, they usually want to do it again." But cruises aren't limited to parties, Lober said. Customers have chartered boats for banquets, retreats, new product introductions, incentive awards dinners and for scattering loved ones' ashes. About 60 percent of Star Fleet's business is repeat and referral. The recent corporate party featuring the Mae West look-alike was the fifth the company has chosen to have with Star Fleet. Part of Lober's initial marketing problem - which continues today - is that Houstonians just don't realize how close to the water they are. "It's not like Fort Lauderdale, where water is part of the landscape," he said. "In Houston, there's no high-visibility location to see the water, just one spot on Loop 610 that overlooks the Port of Houston. Even in Clear Lake, there are only one or two places when you drive around the lake that you can actually see the water. We don't have a San Francisco Bay or New York Harbor. So people have to be reminded." He also has to deal with the misconception that only the very rich can afford cruises, Lober said. "Some people think they can't afford a luxury yacht, but when they compare our complete package with upscale restaurants, hotel banquet facilities, country clubs and wedding manors, we are quite competitive," he said. "And our food is gourmet quality. Just like a five-star hotel, we never cut corners." Event cruises start at $40 per guest including food, bar, entertainment, tax and gratuities. Lober depends heavily on customer surveys to develop the service he and his crew provide. And customers informally give Star Fleet staff new ideas with some of the extras they bring aboard, such as the squirt guns, Mardi Gras beads, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks. "We learn a lot from our customers," he said. "We see what they do, take the best and give it back to them." Because customer surveys indicate that about 20 percent of Star Fleet's business comes from being seen on the water, Lober and his captains make their crafts as visible as possible whenever they take them out. The real opportunity for hot-dogging comes when a customer charters two or three boats, and they raft up to become the Star Fleet flotilla, with customers moving from one boat to another. A three-boat charter can handle up to 375 guests. But one boat can still do a lot of advertising. At the recent corporate party, Mae West joined the other revelers who were slinging Mardi Gras beads at al fresco diners as Capt. Tony DeFore edged Star Gazer close to the Kemah waterfront. They may not have known it, but they were doing a little of Lober's public relations work for him. As the boat pulled back into the Star Fleet Marina, Lober pointed out a barge under construction. When it is finished - by the end of the year, he hopes - the bottom floor will be a galley for food preparation, the second the Star Fleet office and the third floor an 1,800-square-foot apartment. It will kind of resemble that three-tiered wooden box he brought home from school years ago, Lober says. And he's going to live at the top.Photos: 1-2.

More power to reform agendaSoma Banerjee05/13/2001The Economic TimesCopyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)THE electricity industry is often identified as the black sheep in the infrastructure sector which has continued to lag behind despite an overdose of government support. Despite being one of the earlier industries to be opened up, private investments in this sector have failed to take off.Worse, the only sizeable project which was something to write home about Enrons Dabhol Power plant in Maharashtra is currently a under cloud with its promoters involved in a legal battle with the state entity and its sole consumer for non-payment of bills. Policy makers and investors in the energy sector are still groping to find ways and means to improve the performance of this key industry. Although private investments were expected to come in a big way in creating new capacities, policy uncertainties and above all the poor financial health of the consumer, in most cases the SEBs, have posed major problems for power plant developers. After about ten years of liberalisation, the private sector has to its credit only about 5000 MW and according to projections by experts investments in greenfield projects are unlikely before four to five years. The factors that have been taken into consideration in the current projection are almost inbuilt into the system. For one, there is a general agreement that stressing on generation alone without doing much on the distribution front has eroded the financial health of most SEBs. ``Private power developers cannot be expected to invest in projects till they are assured that they will be paid for the energy produced, experts say. But like the recent Montek Singh Ahluwalia report maintains, such reforms cannot be done overnight and will require minimum five to seven years before they break even. The sector has already seen major exits like Cogentrix and Powergen and if the current trends are anything to go by it would not be long before Enron too says Sayonara India, claim sources in the power industry. IPPAI, an association for private power investments, feels that the flip-flop by the government as far as power policies are concerned have made it difficult for investors to take decisions. ``Take this as an example at one time there were more than 200 MoUs signed up for private power projects, the government provided counter guarantees for eight projects, of which only three have taken off. Of this the Enron project is already facing problems of nonpayment, says a senior source. According to estimates drawn up by financial institutions like Power Finance Corporation an organisation responsible for monitoring the financial health of the SEBs and helping them with their reform programmes almost all the SEBs have registered a negative turnover. Which is why the financing or escrowability of SEBs across the country has been reduced to zero. According to Union power minister Suresh Prabhu, the states are now responsive to changes and reforms and the recent drive initiated by the Centre to work with the state governments was expected to yield results. But this sector has seen far too many committees which have failed to yield much hope and it is only sheer determination of SEBs and political will that can help this backbencher.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

India Power Min: New Power Deal With Enron Unit PossibleBy Himendra KumarOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES05/12/2001Dow Jones International News(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India is hopeful the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's power purchase agreement with the U.S. energy company Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit Dabhol Power Co. can be renegotiated and the DPC's dispute over payments be settled, the country's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu said. In a weekend interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Prabhu said the very fact that the DPC had come to the negotiating table for discussions on its power price was an indication that Enron was keen to save its India project.A special panel, set up by the Maharashtra state government, met with representatives of the DPC, for the first time Friday and agreed to another meeting May 23. Friday's meeting lasted for more than two hours. "I am of the view that a negotiated settlement is possible since the first meeting of DPC with the Maharahtra state expert panel went off well. There has been a positive response both from the DPC and the MSEB after the meeting. The central government will also reciprocate by participating in a meaningful dialogue. The next meeting will really decide on how it all goes," Prabhu said. Earlier this week, in an e-mail to Dow Jones Newswires from Houston, Enron Vice President John Ambler however, said, "While we have constantly maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving issues, this (Friday) meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from DPC to renegotiate the terms of the contract." The Maharashtra state government contends that the price paid for electricity from the Dabhol power plant, India's biggest-ever foreign investment at $2.9 billion, is "unaffordable" and seeks to renegotiate tariffs. A recent committee appointed by the government, the Godbole panel, recommended that the power purchase agreement be renegotiated. Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. Critics object to Dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=INR46.8825) a kilowatt-hour for its power, compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. The 2,184-megawatt DPC project in Maharashtra has been mired in financial disputes after the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its main customer, failed to pay the December 2000 and January bills. The Godbole panel is working toward lowering the DPC's power tariff and allowing the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. A restructuring of the DPC's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. The Maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month. The DPC currently operates a 740-megawatt naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to India's installed capacity. Enron has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second phase of the Dabhol project that will add 1,444 MW to its capacity. The plant will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in the DPC and is the project's largest shareholder. Other shareholders include the MSEB with 15%, and General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel Enterprises (X.BTL) with 10% each. -By Himendra Kumar, Dow Jones Newswires; 91-11-461-9427; himendra.kumar@dowjones.comCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. India: Talks begin on Dabhol issue05/12/2001Business Line (The Hindu)Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia Intelligence WireMUMBAI, May 11. OFFICIALS of Enron India today met the expert committee headed by Dr Madhav Godbole to discuss the fate of Enron's Dabhol Power Company. Mr A.V. Gokak, Union Government representative, who was appointed only last night, could not attend the meeting due to the short notice.Lenders to the project who were to attend the meeting stayed away. Instead, Mr A.G. Karkhanis, former Executive Director, Industrial Development Bank of India, attended as observer on behalf of foreign and Indian lenders, Mr Vinay Mohan Lal, Energy Secretary, told reporters here after the meeting. When asked about Enron's reluctance to renegotiate, Mr Lal said: "They are coming again on May 23. What does that mean?" Though none of those present at the meeting was willing to give more details, senior State Government officials had earlier told Business Line that the State would be willing to discuss phase II only after a decision on the rebate slapped on DPC. "Basically our strategy will be to bring the Rs 401- crore rebate payable by DPC to the centre-stage," the official said. "The company has not mentioned a single word about the rebate in any of their letters to either the MSEB or the State. And we, on the other hand, have discussed anything but the rebate in our letters to DPC," he said. Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, Enron India, did not comment on whether the company would issue the preliminary termination notice. The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) Chairman, Mr Vinay Bansal, and Mr Lal had last evening briefed the Democratic Front constituents about their stand vis-a-vis Enron. They are understood to have told the political brass of the State that MSEB does not need the second phase of the Dabhol power project. They categorically said MSEB would not buy power from DPC-phase II, it is learnt. MSEB also reiterated its stand that DPC should adjust the dues owed by it against the non-performance penalty. Senior MSEB officials said the board had replied to the arbitration notice issued by DPC and made its position clear. The board is of the opinion that DPC should adjust Rs 213 crore - the December and January bills - against the Rs 401 crore penalty for performance default. The State Government also has backed the MSEB in its replies to the three arbitration notices served on it. It has said that since MSEB does not accept the charges - non-compliance with the power purchase agreement (PPA) - leveled against it, the State is not bound to pay. The Centre too is understood to have backed MSEB in its preliminary reply to the conciliation notice from DPC. Today's meeting was attended by Mr Cline, Mr Neil McGregor, President, DPC, Mr Mukesh Tyagi, Vice-President, DPC, and Mr Sanjeev Khandekar, VP, DPC, and Mr Mohan Gurunath, Chief Financial Officer, DPC. Among the renegotiation panel members, Mr Deepak Parekh, Mr E A S Sarma and Mr Kirit Parikh were also unable to attend. The next meeting is scheduled on May 23, Mr Lal said. Gokak nominated to panel: The Government has nominated former fertiliser and telecom secretary, Mr A.V. Gokak, to the arbitration committee involving Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The Power Ministry had earlier mooted the additional solicitor general, Mr Harish Salve's candidature for the job. The conciliation process, however, has been hanging fire as the third conciliator is yet to be appointed. Dabhol Power Company had written to the Centre last month seeking six names for selection of a mutually acceptable conciliator to kick- start the conciliation process. DPC's letter to the Finance Ministry was seen in the context of the substantial delay between the initiation of the conciliation process three weeks ago and the finalisation of the conciliators. Soon after the conciliation process was initiated, DPC decided to invoke political force majeure and moved in for arbitration - a prelude to termination of the project.

India to allow 3rd party sale if DPC, MSEB jointly approach05/12/2001Press Trust of India Limited(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.Mumbai, May 12 (PTI) The Federal Government will allow sale of power to a "willing buyer" if the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) will together approach the power ministry with a concrete proposal for their 2,184 mw project in Dabhol. "I will give whatever status they want, including a mega project one, if DPC and MSEB jointly approach the Centre (Federal Government) for the same", Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told reporters here Saturday.He said the Indian Government would extend its cooperation to the Maharashtra government (western state) "in every way" to resolve the imbroglio between MSEB and DPC. When pointed out that both the state government and DPC were of the opinion that federal power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) should buy the power, Prabhu said NTPC cannot do so as it was power selling entity and not buying one. "There is no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long term power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed by NTPC with the buying states", he reiterated. Prabhu said the Indian Government would also try and find out potential buyers of DPC power "if other states were willing to buy the same". Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 300-400 MW needed for the state from the 740 MW phase-I and soon to be commissioned phase-II of 1,444 MW, to other needy states.

LOCAL STORIESDEFAZIO CALLS FOR STATE TO BUY PGE TO PROTECT RATESDAVE HOGAN AND JEFF MAPES of the Oregonian Staff05/12/2001Portland OregonianSUNRISEC01(Copyright (c) The Oregonian 2001)Summary: The suggestion generates little enthusiasm and critics suspect it's motivated by the lawmaker's possible race for governor "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale markets." -- U.S. REP. PETER DeFAZIO D-ORE.The state of Oregon should consider buying investor-owned Portland General Electric to help protect Oregonians from gyrations in the electricity market, U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio declared Friday. Gov. John Kitzhaber reacted politely and said he'll explore the idea, but others said it's a long shot because of political, financial and timing factors. Critics said the proposal appeared aimed more at attracting attention to DeFazio's potential candidacy for governor than anything else. Several companies already are considering buying the utility, but DeFazio said state ownership could help keep PGE customers' electricity rates low and generate profits that could help the rest of Oregon. "I believe this is an extraordinary opportunity and a way that we can insulate almost a quarter of our population and a core of Oregon's business community from the craziness that is going on in the energy wholesale markets," said DeFazio, D-Ore. PGE serves about 725,000 retail customers, mostly in the Portland area, and is owned by Houston-based Enron Corp. PGE's sale to Nevada's Sierra Pacific Resources for $3.1 billion officially fell apart last month. Other possible buyers include Northwest Natural and ScottishPower, which owns PacifiCorp. While Enron and PGE officials declined to comment Friday, legislative leaders showed no particular enthusiasm for DeFazio's idea. "I appreciate his efforts, but I don't think it's the right idea at this time," said House Speaker Mark Simmons, R-Elgin. He said the state already has a package of bills aimed at spurring more energy production and conservation. Senate President Gene Derfler, R-Salem, said he'd be willing to sit down and talk with DeFazio. "I would not just shut the door," he said, but he doesn't plan to devote much work to the proposal. Derfler questioned whether state government could run a utility as efficiently as a business. DeFazio said a PGE purchase would offer several benefits. State ownership would put control of PGE in local hands instead of those of a faraway corporation such as ScottishPower. For PGE customers, state ownership would provide some protection and stability in electricity rates. It also would be a good investment that would pay for itself and perhaps pump revenue back into the state's coffers. The purchase could be financed with tax-exempt bonds sold by the state. DeFazio said state Treasurer Randall Edwards had told him the idea was "in the realm of possibility." DeFazio's idea is an intriguing one and could provide some benefits, said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens' Utility Board, which represents customers of investor-owned utilities such as PGE. Jenks said the primary benefit would be that, if the state bought PGE, the utility would be able to buy lower-priced electricity from the Bonneville Power Administration, which is required to sell power at lower rates to publicly owned utilities. However, a publicly owned PGE wouldn't be able to buy the lower-priced BPA power for about five years because of electricity sales contracts that already are in place. And even if PGE were able to buy lower-priced BPA power, that wouldn't necessarily translate to lower electricity bills for PGE customers, Jenks said. In addition, he said it could increase rates for other publicly owned utilities because the BPA has a shortage of cheap hydropower. The state Public Utility Commission would have to approve any sale of PGE, but outgoing PUC Chairman Ron Eachus criticized DeFazio's proposal, saying it had the potential to increase rates both for PGE customers and for publicly owned utilities. He also said it seemed designed to get political attention for DeFazio's potential candidacy. "I think we're in the political season where people are proposing grandiose schemes that aren't very well thought out, and this seems to be one of those," Eachus said. DeFazio conceded that a high-profile proposal focused on a Portland-area issue such as the ownership of PGE would be a good way for a candidate to build support for a run for governor, but he said that had nothing to do with his plan.

BEGGSAssociated Press Writer05/11/2001Associated Press NewswiresCopyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.SALEM, Ore. (AP) - Congressman Peter DeFazio on Friday proposed that the state buy Portland General Electric as a way to hold down power costs. The Democrat outlined his plan after presenting it to Gov. John Kitzhaber, who said he would ask his energy advisers to analyze it.PGE is Oregon's biggest electric utility, serving more than 700,000 customers. DeFazio said a state purchase of the company could insulate many Oregonians from "the craziness in power markets." DeFazio said the state could buy the company by issuing revenue bonds and have the utility operate as a public power entity. He said the purchase would give the state a diverse mix of transmission rights along with hydropower, gas, coal and renewable energy sources. "While I have not exhaustively researched the proposal, it does appear to be feasible," said DeFazio, an opponent of electric deregulation. Enron Corp., the Texas-based owner of PGE, is trying to sell the utility. Sierra Pacific last month abandoned its plan to buy PGE for $3.1 billion, citing increasing difficulties in the current market and the political environment in the West. Kitzhaber said he's not opposed to the idea of the state buying a private utility, as long as it would benefit consumers. DeFazio said PGE has been a profitable company, and putting it in public ownership could give it preference over private utilities for the Bonneville Power Administration's hydropower. The congressman's suggestion wasn't welcomed by the Legislature. "Thanks, but no thanks," said House Speaker Mark Simmons. "Philosophically, I think it's the wrong approach," he said. "We have a bipartisan package of bills dealing with the issue." Among those are his measure to delay partial electric deregulation for large businesses and a bill to speed up the process for siting temporary generating plants. Senate President Gene Derfler didn't reject the idea, but said the Legislature doesn't have enough time in the current session to take on a job like a utility purchase.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Can we meet at 5:00 today?
Adam:Good question.  The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly identical product.  The fight is over which execution model is superior.  I would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct.  It's happened in Europe already.  The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry.  Within weeks, the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically.  I still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct.  The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful.  It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address.

Andy:Good to hear.  There continue to be a proliferation of new systems coming online in the US; two more start in the next two months.  We are pretty close to finalizing a plan to open our system to everyone in terms of accepting limit orders and posting best bid/offer regardless of whose it is.  In this framework, Enron would sleeve credit for free should two third parties be matched on our system.  However, we would hold the book, getting to see what everyone was doing at all times.  The idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you want to discuss.
the market had to get to a price whereby these guys shut down.  there is just not enough gas to allow everybody who wants to to burn it.  the elasticity of demand is in the industrial sector.  million dollar question is have we gotten to a high enough price whereby we end the year with gas in the ground and deliverability to meet a late cold snap.  shutdown of processing, distillate and resid switching, loss of industrial load...maybe we have.good holidays,johnslafontaine@globalp.com on 12/22/2000 07:11:26 AMTo: slafontaine@globalp.comcc:  Subject: Plants Shut Down and Sell the EnergySubject:  Plants Shut Down and Sell the EnergyPlants Shut Down and Sell the EnergyBy Peter BehrWashington Post Staff WriterThursday, December 21, 2000; Page E01Kaiser Aluminum Corp. had planned to spend December making aluminum at itsgiant smelters in the Pacific Northwest, run by electricity from theBonneville Power Administration's Columbia River dams. Then it saw a betterdeal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hittingunheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It isselling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what itpays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.It is a measure of this winter's fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms inenergy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and evenoil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity ornatural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such largeindustrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But theyalso are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminumand fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt toconsumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said."The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don't knowwhat they're going to use to grow crops with," said David Wyss, chiefeconomist at Standard & Poor's. Some economists have recently increasedtheir warnings about the damaging impact of this winter's heating bills onan already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimatedthat gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for atypical U.S. household.That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higherenergy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expectedgrowth in the nation's economic output by one percentage point on an annualrate in the first three months of next year. "Overall, the recent energyprice developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economicslowdown," the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., inSioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which usenatural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, thecompany realized it would be much more profitable to stop production inDecember and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under itsexisting December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrativeofficer."We looked at these [current] prices and said, 'This is crazy,' " he said.Terra hasn't disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, butRosenbury said it would be "substantial."  In coming months, Terra's goodfortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and theprices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-evenpoint. That would keep Terra's plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminatethe opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. "If this persists,"Rosenbury said, "it's going to be a real problem."He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn't operatingnow. "Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It's possible thatfarmers will not have as much as they want," Rosenbury said. Royster-ClarkInc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer anddistributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning nextmonth. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justifycontinued production. "We believe it's likely this is a speculative bubble[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we'll be able tobuy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen," said PaulM. Murphy, the company's managing director for financial planning. Acontinuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production andraise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers' decisions toplant feed corn, he said. "It's sticker shock."According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gasremains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In thealuminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, theindustry's No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O'Carroll, ananalyst with BB&T Capital Markets in Richmond.Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,and December's production will be lower still, he said. "We'll get moreproduction cut announcements, I think," he said. A slowing in the U.S. andworld economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminumsupplies. "But if the world economy doesn't fall completely apart, then[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly morethan the current forecast," he said. In Kaiser's case, it's an open questionhow much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractuallyentitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonnevillefor $550 a megawatt hour for December.But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and futureprofits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund toBonneville's other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser andBonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect afternext October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveriesto Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. "Outhere, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be anethical dimension to this and we're not shy in trying to make sure they liveup their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power," Moseysaid., 2000 The Washington Post Company
Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal.  Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal.   From:  Russell Dyk @ ENRON                           10/23/2000 12:43 PMTo: Paul Radous/Corp/Enron@ENRONcc: Per Sekse/NY/ECT@ECT, Caroline Abramo/Corp/Enron@Enron, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sara Shackleton/HOU/ECT@ECT, William S Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: CSFB Columbia/Appalachia Hedging DealThe New York office has been speaking to Credit Suisse First Boston for roughly 6 months about a producer hedging deal that is part of a strucutured deal they're putting together. It now looks as if it will get done in the next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken care of. In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is 17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the producers' total volumes. I've attached a spreadsheet to this message with more details. There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to clarify. First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it,  for the December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment would take place on February 15, 2000. Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. (CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they've done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue).  There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB's dealings with EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this transaction.CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end of this week. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.Regards,Russ

The idea is that if we can move the industry's order flow from 30-40% EOL to 60% EOL, we get a huge information advantage in addition to a couple trading advantages, namely we have first priority on all numbers even if we are joining a limit bid posted by a counterparty before us and second, we posess a proprietary stack manager that will allow us to transact on attractive limit orders faster than our competitors.  Still working on technical issues.  The decision to open EOL markets would be done on a product by product basis.  Give me a call if you want to discuss.Andrew Fairley03/13/2001 11:14 AMTo: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECTcc:  Subject: Re: Trip to Houston  JohnRedmond & I have now had a few weeks to implement some of your advice with regard to EOL for UK gas.We have managed to double our average daily volumes, and are capturing a considerably greater share of the market.

One more thing I did not address.  My ultimate goal is to move all volume to EOL.  However, in addition to the NYMEX, we have about 6 other viable electronic trading systems.  We make it a point to never support these if possible.  We will only trade if the other system's offer is at or greater than our bid.  For instance, if we are 6/8 but have a strong inclination to buy and another system is at 7, I will simultaneously lift their 7's and move my market to 7/9.  The lesson the counterparty gets is he will only get the trade if I'm bidding 7 and he will only get executed when it is a bad trade to him.  People have learned fairly quickly not to leave numbers on the other systems because they will just get picked off.  If they don't post numbers on the other systems, the systems get no liquidity and die.I mention this because I have heard that Enron is a fairly large trader on Spectron's system.  I don't know whether it is in regards to gas, power, or metals.  Just something to think about and maybe talk about with the other traders.JohnAndrew Fairley02/20/2001 11:15 AMTo: Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Neal/HOU/ECT@ECT, Thomas A Martin/HOU/ECT@ECT, Barry Tycholiz/NA/Enron@ENRON, Keith Holst/HOU/ECT@ectcc: David Gallagher/LON/ECT@ECT Subject: Trip to HoustonThank you so much for your time last week.David and I found the time especially valuable.

can we meet at 4:00 instead?
Tell him I'm free to meet Oct 19, 2085 at 2:00 AM.  See if that's ok with him.
would like to meet to review to make sure i understand.  may only take a couple minutes.  are you free at 330 on tuesday?
For anybody that doesnt know, Maggi resigned today to go to El Paso.  I will be sending out an email with a broader distribution this afternoon.  Please keep this quiet until then.  Plan to meet at 4:30 today to discuss the ongoing structure of the desk.  
schedule 30 min to sit down with me either mon or tues after 430.  if you want to get info, sending out an email survey is not the right way.  much easier to respond to a question in voice rather than typing it out.
Gad:Sorry for the extremely late response.  Despite the fact that Eva referred you, we would have interest in meeting with you about emplyment opps. I was planning on going to NY in a couple weeks but at this point, I don't know.  I would highly recommend that you follow the formal recruitment program in addition to any talks we have.  Although I can recommend to make you an offer, it is much easier if it is done in parallel with the associate recruitment program.  After the current events calm down, we can talk via phone about my experience here and why I think there are some good opportunities here. 
want to play hookie and go to the bb game tomorrow at noon?
i have a meeting with Heath Schiesser (VP of Xcelerator) today.  can I  join the trucking fundies group instead?
Sarah,Thanks to you and Jennifer for arranging.   I will be in attendance at 3:00 pm and have asked either Jim Crowder or Everett Plante to also attend.   I do not know their availability yet due to the Enron PRC meeting conflicts.   Is it possible for me to attend starting at 1:00 pm - I have not been through a complete Experience Enron meeting ?thanks again for your help.Kim Sarah-Joy Hunter@ENRON11/30/00 06:16 PM  To: Kim Godfrey/Enron Communications@Enron Communications cc: Jennifer Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron, Colleen Koenig/NA/Enron@Enron Subject: invitation to meeting with senior Compaq executives from 1-4PM 3 Allen Center 11C1, December 14thHi Kim,Hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  Jennifer Stewart Medcalf had asked me to invite you to a meeting with senior Compaq executives onDecember 14th.  Though the meeting will start at 1PM, Jennifer is specifically requesting your presence from 3-4 PM when discussions will focus on the Compaq/EBS relationship.  Other Compaq executives besides "Keith" will be there.An agenda and listing of attendees will be e-mailed to you the week of December 11th.Thanks for confirming back with Jennifer Medcalf your availability, from 3-4 PM, December 14th.  She can be reached at ext.#6-8235.Sarah-Joy Hunter
David and Bob,We look forward to working with you to strengthen the Compaq and EBS relationship.   EBS has identified potential server business opportunities (storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.  After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as the point person for these communications.  EBS had prior direction from Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe or Kent Major.  Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and issues.  EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop the streaming media server solutions.  We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions.  EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions.  To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our relationship.  The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change.  Until those changes are made:1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services:  Per the Agreement, Compaq was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3.  Compaq had agreed  to the invoice amount.  EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 on or before December 31,2000.   2) Potential for Agreement Termination:  Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself).   The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000.  The concept to start over with a new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting.  EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.  Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.

Karen,Thank you for the update.  It looks like we'll plan on having the EBS/Avaya meetings on January 10th and 11th, 2001.  The first day will be a full day, the second will be 1/2 day, a.m. session.  You have asked me to provide a list of Enron attendees, titles, which day(s) they would likely attend, and some background information on the meeting(s) purposes.  An explanation of the meetings' proposed focus and probable attendees is in the attached meeting notes.  The notes are from the November meeting which we coordinated and held for Enron Broadband Services and Dave Johnson.  By copy of this note to Kim Godfrey, we'll update the EBS executives on the meetings, and work on arranging their calendar availability.  So far, we have had the EBS execs' calendars penciled in for the time slot of January 9-11.  At this point, I would expect that the EBS attendee list would look something like this:  Jim Crowder, VP, Enterprise Services; Enron Broadband Services - day 2 Everett Plante, VP and CIO, Enron Broadband Services - day 2Larry Ciscon, VP Software Architecture, EBS - day 1&2  (selected team members of Larry's organization - individuals TBD by Larry) - day 1  Steve Pearlman, VP, Strategic Development, EBS - day 2 and/or day 1Kim Godfrey, Director, East Origination, EBS - day 1&2  Jeff Youngflesh, Director, Business Development, Enron Global Strategic Sourcing - day 1&2      (others as suggested by Kim Godfrey or other EBS executive)From Avaya, the EBS team would like to meet with Dave Johnson, Serge Minassian, John Stephenson, and their selected Avaya team members.  Per my conversation with you earlier today, the Enron Broadband Services meetings w/Avaya will need to be scheduled such that the overall agenda will "flip-flop" day 1 with day 2.  Originally, the first day was going to be a half-day executive strategizing meeting in the p.m. (allowing for travel to NJ), and the 2nd day to be more a product- or solutions-focused effort, with a full day's agenda.  Based on the fact that Dave Johnson will only be available the morning of the 11th, the meeting schedule will be reversed, such that the "full day/products/solutions" meetings will precede the half-day executive strategy sessions.  I have checked w/Barbara Korp, and Serge Minassian and John Stephenson are both available on the 11th, as well (John Stephenson would have a hard stop at 10:30).Thank you,Jeff Youngflesh713-345-5968
sure, stop by and we'll arrange a place to meet.  If you come by  during trading hours though, I can only say hi for a couple seconds.
Jeff,As of Dec 14th, Enron received the message regarding David Spurlin greater involvement in the EBS relationship.   In the past, EBS had included David on the direction of our relationship and not the details.   Our prior direction was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication.   In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement.   I would like to fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history.   During the meetings in August 2000,  EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended.  There was a group of at least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq).  Both EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services.   Spreadsheets were exchanged between both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon.   A significant amount of time was spent in this process between August through October.   EBS and Compaq (Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 sections.   This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for comments in November.   EBS has not heard anything regarding the language.  During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000.   The EBS concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services.  This was reason for the development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000).   EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with our relationship.Kim GodfreyDirector, Enterprise ServicesEnron Broadband Servicesphone : 713 345 8813cell :      713 501 8105fax:        713 853 7354
Mr. Shankman:In preparation for the meeting on December 12th with Larry Kellner, CFO, Continental Airlines, I have noted below some background on the Enron/Continental relationship and the purpose for the meeting.  Mr. Shankman, please advise if you would like me to distribute this to the attendees.    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:Over the past several years Enron has been hedging Continental's crude oil.  The relationship has been beneficial to both sides.  As a result, since 1999 Enron has made over $9 million and Continental has saved over $45 million.  The purpose for the December 12th meeting is to address three initiatives in order of economic value:  (1) fuel management, (2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.   Several new initiatives being proposed to Continental include the following:   exchanging call options on crude oil for airline tickets (Craig Breslau, Originator)  transacting financial swaps on line (Larry Gagliardi, Originator)  creating a weather derivative product for the airline industry (Mark Tawney and Gary Taylor, Originators)outsourcing Continental's antifreeze and plastics risks by hedging these products with Enron (Alan Engberg, Originator)Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:Ron Howard, Vice President, Food ServicesLarry Kellner, Chief Financial OfficerGreg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management CompanyJeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)Meeting Attendees from Enron:Jeff Shankman, President and COO, Enron Global MarketsJohn Nowlan, Vice President, Enron Global MarketsCraig Breslau, Vice President, Enron North AmericaMark Tawney, Director, Enron Global Markets (tentative) DISCUSSION: (Developed through conversations with Alan Engberg, Larry Gagliardi, Gary Taylor, Craig Breslau, Tracy Ramsey and Lucy Ortiz.)Enron Buy Side with Continental:Current Enron verifiable spend on Continental airline tickets was approximately $40 million in FY 1999 and $17.5 million for the first six months of 2000.  Enron Sell Side with Continental:(1) FUEL MANAGEMENT: Current Business:  Over the past 2 years, Craig Breslau and others have been managing a strong relationship with Greg Hartford, VP, Continental Fuel Management, hedging Continental's crude oil.  The first transaction was on January 14, 1998 -- a one month Forward on Kero.  Since then, Enron has completed 29 transactions with two commodities:  KERO and Crude.  Current business consists of three crude call options, settling in December 2000 ($31.00) and January, 2001 ($34.00 and $35.00)Value to Enron: Enron has earned $9,682,084 (1999-October 6, 2000)Value to Continental:  Continental has saved $45,001,744 (1999-October 6, 2000)Possible next steps:    (a) A transaction where Enron exchanges call options on crude oil for airline tickets.(b) Financial jet swaps on line:  Larry Gagliardi has already spoken with Rick Pressly, Director, Continental Fuel Management, regarding financial jet swaps on line.   At the time, Pressly was not interested in pursuing this product offering.  Value to Continental for (b):  a more perfect hedge as opposed to hedging with crude oil since hedging jet fuel with jet is a more perfect hedge.  Enron could offer services for the whole year and explore multi-year options as well both with financial and physical jet fuel.Possible next steps:  Would Larry Kellner be interested in (a) or (b)?  Enron could also supply Continental with jet fuel physical in the following locations such as the US Gulf Coast, New York harbor, the US West Coast, and Europe.  (Enron is doing this now with Delta airlines in New York harbor).  If so, Gagliardi could provide a guest password and Enron Online identification number if Kellner's office wanted to review the product.(2) WEATHER DERIVATIVE  PRODUCT:Business proposition:  Create a basket of weather related risks - such that aggregate bad weather above a tolerable level would result in payment from Enron to Continental.Continental Airlines clearly has exposure to weather as indicated in their annual reports and periodic press releases - particularly those discussing earnings.  It is extremely difficult to envision the perfect weather hedge for all of Continental's weather related exposure.  However, it is not difficult to envision simple ways to reduce a large portion of it.  Continental has hubs in Houston, Newark, and Cleveland.  The weather conditions that create delays and increased costs in these areas include - rainfall above certain amounts, snowfall above certain amounts, temperatures below freezing (de-icing costs), winds above a certain speed, etc.  Value to us:  Create value by designing a basket of these risks.  Value to them:  Creation of a weather hedge to protect Continental's exposure.Possible next steps:   Upper management would need to issue a directive to various groups within Continental to describe what weather conditions affect the bottom line, how much they affect the bottom line, and then ask each group to attach a "confidence level" to each of their estimates - Continental could start a weather risk management program by only hedging a weighted average of their exposure x their confidence level - or some portion thereof.Exposure areas would be categorized according to the following:Clear exposure.  Quantifiable.Clear exposure.  Difficult to quantifyPotential exposure.  QuantifiablePotential exposure.  Difficult to quantifyFor each of the above categories, Enron would also need an indication of whether Continental has historical cost data against which we can regress historical weather data.Enron's weather derivatives team could then sit down with Kirk Rummel, Director and Airport Services Division Controller, and some of his team (or others designated by Kellner) and brainstorm about different types of weather that cause increased cost to Continental.  (Gary Taylor made a brief presentation to Rummel on November 6th; no follow up action with Enron has taken place to date)  (3)  PLASTICS:Business proposition:    Alan Engberg proposed that Continental outsource their antifreeze risk (ethylene glycol / propylene glycol) and plastics (high impact polystyrene, polyethylene) by hedging those products with Enron.Value to Continental: Cost/Budget certainty (assuming a perfect hedge whereby their purchase contracts are linked to the index used for hedging) and associated reduction in volatility of cash flowsValue to Enron:  The value is approximately $2 million notional value if they hedged 100% of their 4 million pound polystyrene exposure.  Since Continental has not yet shared the size of their antifreeze buy, Engberg cannot comment on the potential value to Enron though he is fairly certain it would be much larger than $2 million.Possible next stepsThis proposition is being considered by Ron Howard's team at Continental.  Continental needs to share their antifreeze spend with Enron.  Enron could then develop a proposal to Continental that includes perceived benefits of outsourcing their commodity risk to Enron.  Could a follow-up meeting with Ron Howard's team and Larry Kellner's designated contact be arranged to facilitate this process?Alan Engberg also recommends working with Continental on a strategic approach to modelling their overall exposures using VaR may prove extremely powerful and rewarding to both companies.  David Port is already (x-39823)  looking at ways to outsource Enron's expertise in this area.  Continental could be a pioneer in the effort.  Factors to model wouldinclude jet fuel, natural gas, electricity, currency, interest rates, plastics, antifreeze, paper, and, metal.

Thad,Would you please get the calendars of your execs synchronized, and tell us which 2-day period the week of January 8 - 12, 2001 works best for our mutual meetings?  We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in NJ.  Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week.  However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I need your help in an expedited way - I'll need to give Kim your executives' availability during that week, and then we'll get things locked in ASAP.The meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of meeting time for the executives (VP & up, primarily) to discuss possible alignments and opportunities.  This would include two primary areas:1)  EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use:  what types of potential solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya's internal use; and2)  EBS & Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the (common) markets served:  "sell with" (each other); and "sell through" (channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as sales channels for each other's sales forces.These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day's session(s), which would include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value propositions, such that they would have a "jumping off point" for a go-to-market effort (item #2, above).  In addition, the technical aspects of some of the "EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use" (item #1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be addressed.Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives' schedules locked into days synchronized with your executives'.

Jennifer,I spoke w/Jenny Rub about almost every BMC/EBS issue, except for this one.  I did not know about the issue which Bruce Smith has sent (blue text, below) to Jenny and Bob McAuliffe.  When I spoke w/Jenny, I was unaware of BMC's retraction.  It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn't seem very "customer-focused" on BMC's part.  I certainly agree w/Bruce's statement to the effect that BMC needs to meet w/Philippe about their pricing!JKY

All,In our meeting on the 17th of November, the NetWorks team explained their position(s) relative to possible upcoming purchases of software, in which BMC might be selected as the vendor.  There were several issues and concerns which were voiced, mostly related to BMC's lack of support and suboptimal application capability (that is the "net", understated version).Bob, you and I spoke briefly after the meeting regarding what, if anything, BMC could do to "fix their problem".  I relayed the gist of our brief conversation to EBS.As discussed in the meeting, EBS has a near-term opportunity to get a deal done with BMC, and it would be of optimum benefit to execute this year.  One of the outcomes of our November 17 meeting is that EBS has been pressing BMC for a BMC commitment to Enron's overall customer satisfaction.  Per a voicemail to me from EBS, it appears that BMC have provided a response to EBS.I would like to schedule a meeting for the addressees of this note for either November 30th, or December 1st.  The purpose is to get an update from the NetWorks team on the BMC application testing that was underway, and for EBS to explain what BMC has proposed.  This meeting should take an hour.  Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow or Friday.  I'll book a room and time that works for the majority, and confirm with a Notes "Meeting Invitation".Thank you,Jeff Jeff YoungfleshDirector, Business DevelopmentGlobal Strategic SourcingEnron Corp.333 Clay Street, 11th FloorHouston, TX 77002t:  713-345-5968f:  713-646-2450c:  713-410-6716

"We have around 5,000 employees in Europe and we are seeking to cut our headcount here by between five and 10 percent," John Sherriff, president and CEO of Enron Europe, said in a statement.Enron Metals employees in London were told at a meeting on Tuesday that staff cuts of 10 percent to 20 percent would be required, trade sources said. The company is seeking volunteers to take redundancy, but if sufficient voluntary slots have not been filled by a deadline of October 19, Enron will opt for compulsory cuts, they added. An Enron spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the official statement. "Enron's business continues to grow in Europe in terms of traded volumes and numbers of transactions, but like any company we are constantly seeking ways to do more with less in order to maintain earnings growth," Sherriff said in the statement. "It is prudent for us to keep both a close eye on our costs and to continually review the skills and resources that are available to use to ensure that they are deployed in a way which will maximise earnings," he added. Market sources were not surprised by the move, citing testing conditions facing the metals trading sector as a whole. "At the moment you have low volumes of customer interest combined with difficult trading conditions and high operating costs," said one. "Even if they're making money from EnronOnline, they've got far too many people there." U.S.-based Enron Corp became a major player in the metals trade in May last year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals dealing firm in London which had previously absorbed fellow LME ring-dealers Rudolf Wolff & Co and Billiton Metals Ltd. The number of LME ring dealers trading on the exchange's open-outcry floor has dwindled from a peak of 30 in the mid-1980s to the current 12. This could drop to 11 this week if ScotiaMocatta, a subsidiary of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia , exits floor trading from Friday. In an interview with Reuters in August, Enron Metals President Joe Gold reiterated the company's commitment to the LME ring. "We send our No 1 trader and No 2 trader down on the (LME) floor every day, which is not a statement everyone can make. Wherever the most trading is during that day, that's where we'll be," Gold said. SCREEN TRADING Enron has also become a major player in metals screen trading since July last year, when the company announced the first physical metals transaction on its internet trading platform EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com). The system differs from the screen trading systems operated by the London Metal Exchange (LME) and UK-based metals and energy broker Spectron in that the trading platform is open to a broad range of users but Enron is the sole counter-party in each transaction. At the end of August the company amended EnronOnline to make markets for selected clients only in three months copper and aluminium for maximum 200-lot transactions, compared with the standard 20-lot markets on the system. In addition to metals, EnronOnline trades a range of products, from oil to plastics and emission allowances to credit derivatives. Enron announced the one millionth transaction on the system in May of this year.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Enron Plans to Trim as Many as 500 Jobs in Europe (Update2)2001-10-10 16:08 (New York)Enron Plans to Trim as Many as 500 Jobs in Europe (Update2)     (Updates with closing share price in last paragraph.)     Houston, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largestenergy trader, plans to eliminate as many as 500 jobs in Europe,or as much as 10 percent of the workforce there, to reduce costsand boost profit.     The company has 5,000 workers in Europe, and it plans to trimjobs by 5 percent to 10 percent, Enron said in a statement. Thecompany wants to make reductions through ``voluntary severance,''the statement said.     Houston-based Enron expanded European commodities trading in2000 when it bought London-based MG Plc, the largest coppermarketer, for $448 million. Jeffrey Skilling, who resigned asEnron's chief executive in August, told investors in July toexpect ``great things from Europe in the future.''     ``There is still a lot of growth for them in Europe,'' saidLouis Gagliardi, an analyst at John S. Herold Inc. ``They're notgiving up, they're just taking an analysis of each unit.''Gagliardi doesn't own Enron shares. John S. Herold doesn't issueinvestment recommendations.     Enron Europe is based in London and has offices in nine othercountries. Along with trading, it has interests in power plants inItaly, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the U.K. It didn't say where thejob cuts would be.     Shares of Enron rose $1.81 to $35.20. They have fallen 58percent this year.Northeast Officials Seek Delay In Unifying Power MarketBy Kristen McNamaraOf DOW JONES NEWSWIRES10/10/2001Dow Jones Energy Service(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Officials in Maryland and New York have urged federal energy regulators to slow down plans to merge the three existing wholesale power markets along the Eastern Seaboard into a single market for the entire Northeast. Citing concerns that rushing to consolidate the markets could create instability, reduce liquidity and inflate prices, the New York Independent System Operator and the Maryland Public Service Commission have separately asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to study its plan before implementing it."There's no need to do this in a hasty manner," said Steve Sullivan, spokesman for the New York ISO, which runs that state's power market and transmission system. "Our markets are not broken." FERC is pushing utilities across the country to put their high-voltage transmission systems - the wholesale power market's equivalent of the interstate highway system - under the control of independent regional operators. The commission says the handoff is critical to the establishment of competitive power markets, as utilities with positions in the market are seen as unlikely to allow competitors equal access to the grid. Power traders like Enron Corp. (ENE) support the effort, while some utilities and state regulators have opposed the assertion of federal authority. In an effort to jump-start the sluggish process, FERC has outlined a plan to divide up control of the country's power grids among four regional operators - one each in the Northeast, Southeast, Midwest and West. But while utilities still control much of the grid elsewhere in the country, transmission systems in the Northeast are already run by three independent wholesale market operators. FERC has told those operators to merge, and has indicated a preference for modeling the new market on that run by Mid-Atlantic operator PJM Interconnection LLC. A unified Northeast power market would be the world's largest - processing $9 billion in energy sales a year, handling 110,000 megawatts of electricity and serving a population of 54 million, according to the New York ISO. Seeking Other Options The Maryland Public Service Commission, along with regulators from Virginia and the District of Columbia, filed motions in August to stay FERC's order, saying the commission had overstepped its authority. The Maryland regulators will ask a federal court to block FERC if it moves forward with its plans to consolidate the three market operators - New York ISO, ISO New England Inc. and PJM - said Robert Harris, the commission's assistant manager of external affairs. The commission last week asked U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski. D-Md., to require FERC to explore options to ease the flow of power between markets short of a forced consolidation. "This proposal is unnecessary, reckless and risky," the PSC wrote. The PSC held public hearings on a unified Northeast power market Oct. 3 and 4, and plans to send the comments it received to FERC next week. The New York ISO and ISO New England said they aren't opposed to a consolidated market, as long as it incorporates the best practices from each of the three existing markets. The New York ISO, along with ISO New England, also wants each of the three regional markets to have equal representation on the board governing the merged market. New York's market operator also questioned whether centralizing control of a Northeast power market with one operator in one location would increase its vulnerability to electronic or other attacks by terrorists. FERC will hold a series of workshops next week to discuss issues related to the development of independent transmission operators across the country, including the need to clear bottlenecks and guard against attempts to manipulate the market. As reported, new FERC Chairman Pat Wood III said the commission will spend a day listening to the concerns of state regulators. The commission has also agreed to study its contention that consolidating markets will pay off for consumers, Wood said. Mirant Corp. (MIR) recently commissioned a study that showed a combined Northeast power market could save consumers $440 million a year. -By Kristen McNamara, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2061; kristen.mcnamara@dowjones.comCopyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

INDIA: Reliance plan could sour BG's Indian deal.By Sriram Ramakrishnan10/10/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.BOMBAY, Oct 10 (Reuters) - India's Reliance Industries Ltd wants to become the operator of three oil and gas fields off the country's west coast, complicating U.K.-based BG Plc's proposed acquisition of a 30 percent stake in the fields, an industry source told Reuters on Wednesday. Reliance, which owns a 30 percent stake in the fields, has applied to the government to be appointed the operator, said the source, who declined to be identified.That could potentially derail the deal BG announced last week to buy U.S.-based Enron Corp's 30 percent stake in the offshore Indian energy fields for $388 million. Numerous reports in the Indian media have said that the deal may be contingent on operatorship of the fields being transferred from Enron, the current operator, to BG. A spokesman for BG in London said on Wednesday that the company was "continuing discussions with the other parties" and until the matter was resolved, it had no further comment to make. Indian state-run driller ONGC, which owns the remaining 40 percent stake in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields, has already said it wants to take over the operatorship. The source said Reliance Industries, India's leading petrochemicals maker and flagship company of the country's largest business group, is also pursuing management control. Panna, Mukta and Tapti lie off India's western coast, and are considered among the more promising recent finds in the country. Panna and Mukta produce 29,000 barrels of oil and 2.5 million cubic metres of gas per day. The Mukta field produced 1,974 million cubic metres of gas in the year ended March 2001. BG said it wants a stake in the fields to complement its Indian interests in gas distribution and liquefied natural gas (LNG). Enron wants to leave the venture as a part of its move to focus on the high-growth energy trading business.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. USA: El Paso shares advance after favorable ruling.10/10/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.NEW YORK, Oct 10 (Reuters) - A favorable regulatory ruling sent El Paso Corp's undervalued shares soaring on Wednesday, leading the utility group higher in morning trading. After the close of trading Tuesday, a U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission law judge ruled there was no clear evidence that El Paso exercised market power in an attempt to raise California natural gas prices and recommended dismissal of the issue in the case pending before the full commission.This was "not a clean sweep" for the big gas pipeline company, UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone said, noting Judge Wagner believes there was affiliate abuse - or collusion - between El Paso's pipeline and marketing segments during California's power crisis late last year and early this year. But Barone believes "the net outcome from his decisions are a substantial positive for El Paso and have significantly reduced the company's limited exposure to this highly politicized California mess." In active morning trading, El Paso shares traded between $51 and $51.69 - their best prices since Sept. 17, the first day of trading following the interruption caused by the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. After two hours, El Paso was up $2.50, or 5.13 percent, to $51.25 on composite trading of 1.8 million shares. Following it higher were the stocks of several other companies that had dropped on news of California's problems - Calpine Corp. , up 4.14 percent; Enron Corp. , up 3.26 percent, and Dynegy Inc. , up 2.4 percent.Copyright ? 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

UK: UPDATE 1-ScotiaMocatta seen to axe LME ring trade from Friday.By Martin Hayes10/10/2001Reuters English News Service(C) Reuters Limited 2001.LONDON, Oct 10 (Reuters) - London Metal Exchange (LME) ring-dealer ScotiaMocatta Metals is to scale back its operations, and will no longer execute business on the market's open-outcry floor after Friday, trade sources said on Wednesday. ScotiaMocatta is a unit of Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia , who informed metal traders of the move at a meeting held yesterday in the LME trader's London offices. Voluntary redundancies were also asked for, sources at the meeting said."They said they are restructuring the business, and will no longer execute trades on the floor after Friday," one said. This implies that ScotiaMocatta, which is one of 12 ring-dealing members (RDMs) on the LME, could relinquish this status, although sources at the meeting said this was not made clear. No-one from ScotiaMocatta in London was available to comment on Wednesday. Separately, Enron Group said its commodities trader Enron Metals would also lose jobs as part of a Europe-wide staff reduction programme. On Tuesday, Bank of Nova Scotia said in Toronto it was scaling back its base metals trading desk and laying off traders, transforming ScotiaMoccata into a "niche player", due to the economic downturn. The bank said the decision does not affect its precious metals division. Bank of Nova Scotia purchased Mocatta Metals as it was known in September 1997. It is also one of the five members of the twice-daily London gold fix - it is the oldest bullion dealing house in the world, dating back to 1671. "We are still staying in the base metals business, but it will be more focused as a niche player in structural products," Scotiabank spokeswoman, Diane Flanagan told Reuters in Toronto. Flanagan confirmed there would be layoffs at the bank's base metals desk, but refused to say how many employees would be affected. If ScotiaMoccatta were to give up RDM status, it would bring LME ring-dealing numbers down to 11. The RDMs are the only firms entitled to trade on the open-outcry floor. In the LME's tiered membership, associate broker clearing members (ABCMs) are the second tier of membership - they have all the rights and privileges of LME membership, but cannot trade during the open-outcry trading sessions. LME director of corporate affairs Jonathan Haslam said on Wednesday that any announcement about a firm's membership status would have to come from the company concerned. DOWNTURN IN METALS BUSINESS HITTING HARD Trading conditions in base metals have deteriorated this year, with prices, volumes and revenues all falling, against a background of a global economic slowdown, worsened by the September 11 attacks on the U.S. This climate has hit all trading companies, and ScotiaMocatta's business has declined markedly, sources said. "They have gone from a position of being on the acquisition front to becoming a niche player. That highlights the way their business has declined in the last six months," a source close to the company said. There had been persistent talk that ScotiaMoccata had been looking to acquire other LME RDMs. In 2000, it sought to buy RDM Rudolf Wolff, a unit of Canada's Noranda. Wolff was eventually purchased by MG Trading, now known as Enron Metals This year it was said to be negotiating to buy another RDM, although that ultimately came to nothing. LME RING DEALING NUMBERS CONTINUE TO FALL LME ring-dealership numbers have declined since the mid-1980s, when there were some 30 companies on the floor. This is partly due to consolidation, but also due to some firms relinquishing their status in the wake of the Sumitomo Corp copper scandal in 1996. Now, there are significantly more ABCMs and the trend towards consolidation and contraction is likely to continue, as their costs are much lower than being a ring-dealer. To run a floor operation, with telecommunications and associated staff charges, probably costs between one and two million stg a year.

LOCALUNDERSEA PIPELINE PLAN FACES SCRUTINY ; HEARING SLATED ON ENRON PLAN TO IMPORT GASDavid Fleshler Staff Writer10/10/2001South Florida Sun-SentinelBroward Metro1B(Copyright 2001 by the Sun-Sentinel)State environmental regulators have raised sharp questions about Enron Corp.'s plans to construct an undersea natural gas pipeline from the Bahamas to South Florida. The pipeline would threaten coral reefs, travel through a popular state park and face a series of hazards in the commercial bustle of Port Everglades, according to a memorandum by the Department of Environmental Protection's southeast district staff.The Houston-based company wants to bring natural gas from a plant in Freeport, Grand Bahama, to Fort Lauderdale. With more gas-fueled power plants in the works, the company thinks it would find a market in Florida. El Paso Corp. and AES Corp. also have proposed undersea pipeline projects, although Enron's Calypso project has moved the furthest in the approval process. Judging from the state's comments on Enron's proposal, all three projects will face difficult questions over their safety and environmental impact. Just before it reaches land, for example, the pipeline would pass through Port Everglades, a busy center of commerce that could be full of peril for a high-pressure gas pipeline. "The pipeline will be routed through an area that has experienced chronic disturbances such as dredging, ship groundings, high ship traffic entering and leaving Port Everglades and storm events," states the memo, prepared by Jayne Bergstrom, an environmental specialist who prepared a series of questions for the company. "Large vessels have caused significant damage to Broward County reefs in recent years, including a 506-foot cargo ship, a freighter driven ashore during a February 1998 storm, a 348-foot Panamanian vessel that washed ashore a month later, and incredibly, a 360-foot nuclear-powered sub, the USS Memphis, in February 1993. Is this the safest route for a high-pressure gas pipeline?" Enron spokesman John Ambler said the pipeline probably would be 30 to 40 feet below the sea floor in the port, well protected even if a ship sank or ran aground directly over it. Just outside the port, the pipeline would ascend to 3 feet below the floor, but that would be in a rocky area that's closed to ships, he said. "We're in the process of developing a response to all of these questions," he said. "We're in an ongoing dialogue, and we're optimistic about being able to resolve these concerns in a way that will allow the project to move forward." The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will conduct a public hearing tonight on the environmental impact of the Enron project. The public will be allowed to make comments or ask questions of the agency's staff. The meeting will be at 7 p.m. at the I.T. Parker Community Center, 901 NE Third St., Dania Beach. As the pipeline approaches Broward County's coastline, it would pass through bands of coral reefs, important habitats for marine life. The company plans to drill horizontally under the reefs to avoid harming them. But it also would drag pipes over them in two areas before inserting them through the holes, according to the state. "Coral reefs deserve protection for their intrinsic natural value," the memo states. "In addition, the economic, tourism, fishing and recreational resources of South Florida depend on healthy coral reef ecosystems. Calypso staff and engineers have not sufficiently demonstrated to staff that the project cannot be redesigned to avoid sensitive marine resources." While the company has stated that the impact would be both temporary and insignificant, the memo states that the company has not explained how this could be so. The state estimated that the project would have an impact on about 15 acres of coral reefs and adjacent habitats. Given the damage the reefs already have suffered from pollution and other sources, the memo questions whether any pipelines should be routed directly to southeast Florida. Instead, it says it may be better to route them to the north, through areas without reefs, then connect to the pipeline system on land. Ambler said that the company was trying to find ways to avoid dragging the pipes along the reefs. All three pipeline projects will be reviewed by a series of federal, state and local agencies.

Reliance Bids to Run Indian Oil Fields, Challenging BG Plan2001-10-10 11:34 (New York)Reliance Bids to Run Indian Oil Fields, Challenging BG Plan     Mumbai, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Reliance Industries Ltd.,India's biggest private company, said it claimed the right to runthree offshore oil and gas projects, challenging a bid from theU.K.'s BG Group Plc.     BG has said a plan to buy out Enron Corp.'s 30 percent of theprojects is contingent on winning the right to oversee thedevelopments. Reliance and Oil & Natural Gas Corp., India'sbiggest oil producer, together own 70 percent of the explorationcompany and have an option to decide the operator after Enronquits, Reliance spokesman Yogesh Desai said.     The purchase would gave BG a 30 percent stake in the Taptiand Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields, as well as 63 percent of anuntapped deposit on the west coast of India. The assets hold morethan 170 million barrels of oil and gas. BG declined to comment.     BG will invest ``hundreds of millions'' of dollars to doubleproduction in the Tapti field by 2004 if the other two partners inthe venture contribute as well, Nigel Shaw, chief executiveofficer of BG India Pvt. told reporters last week. ONGC hasalready claimed its right to operate the fields.     Before agreeing with BG, Enron rejected bids from its Indianventure partners, ONGS and Reliance, as well as from the nation'sbiggest refiner, Indian Oil Corp.     India's gas production fell 11 percent to 1999 from 1997 asOil & Natural Gas Corp., the state explorer, made no significantdiscoveries in 15 years. Insufficient supplies of gas have hurtgrowth in the country's fertilizer and chemicals industries andhampered upgrading of its power plants, still mostly coal-fed.     The government expects a gas deficit to triple in the nextsix years unless new wells are drilled or existing fields expandsales.     Domestic bureaucracy has already thwarted efforts in India byElectricite de France and Cogetrix Energy Inc., which have pulledout, while Enron is locked in a price dispute with authorities.The government is the sole buyer of gas and power from producersand the sole seller to distributors.LME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)2001-10-10 11:59 (New York)LME Says Scotiamocatta to End Open-Outcry Floor Trade (Update2)     (Adds bank quotes in second, fifth paragraphs.)     London, Oct. 10 (Bloomberg) -- The London Metal Exchange saidScotiamocatta, a metals-trading unit of the Bank of Nova Scotia,will cease open-outcry transactions on the LME floor.     It was not immediately clear when the company will end floortrading, said Caoimhe Buckley, a spokeswoman for the exchange, theworld's biggest metals-trading bourse. The bank is planning to cutabout 20 base metals staff in London, said Pam Agnew, aspokeswoman in Toronto, though its floor dealing is unaffected fornow. ``At this time, it's business as usual,'' she said.     Scotiamocatta is the latest defection from the LME, whosenumber of floor traders has more than halved to 11 in the pastdecade because of declining margins. This year, the price ofcopper has dropped 23 percent and aluminum has declined 17 percentas slowing economies cut demand and reduce trading commissions.     ``It detracts from (the LME's) standing as a marketplacebecause it's another one gone,'' said Richard Starsmeare, head ofcommodity and trade finance at Raiffeisen Zentralbank in London.     The bank's decision to cut its London metals staff is relatedto the ``downturn in the economy,'' Agnew said.     The LME's director of corporate affairs, Jonathan Haslam,later said the exchange couldn't officially comment onScotiamocatta's role at the exchange.     ``The LME wishes to make clear that it has made no formalstatement about the position of the Bank of Nova Scotia,'' Haslamsaid in a statement. ``Any statements about their future tradingmust come from them.''     The LME's other floor-trading members, or ``ring dealers''include Enron Metals Ltd. and Refco Overseas Ltd.Bin Laden 'look alike' arrested in IndiaBBC NewsOctober 9, 2001By Frances Harrison in Delhi Indian police detained a bearded man in the western border area of Rajasthan on suspicion that he might be the world's most wanted man, Osama Bin Laden. The man was released after two hours of questioning which established that he was in fact a Hindu and also worked for an American company. Police in the town of Jaisalmer bordering Pakistan said they saw a man with a flowing beard and black scarf driving along the national highway in a jeep. They chased the man, took him to the police station and politely asked who he was - clearly concerned they might have apprehended Osama Bin Laden fleeing Aghanistan via Pakistan. US company The bearded man told the police he was an engineer working with the American company Enron on a wind energy project in the area. A telephone call to the company confirmed this and one policeman told the man that he should be thankful he wasn't living in the United States because he would have definitely been shot so strong was his resemblance to Osama Bin Laden. The man, who turned out to be a Hindu and not a Muslim, was freed immediately. But not before a crowd of curious villagers had gathered outside the police station eager to catch a glimpse of the man who's been dominating the news.
